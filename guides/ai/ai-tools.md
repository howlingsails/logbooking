### **AI Tools for Running a 7-Figure SaaS Business**

Last year, my **SaaS business generated more than one million dollars** in total revenue, and it's on track to do at least **1.5 times more in 2025**. But that's not even the most exciting part.

During the past year, I managed to **increase our profit margin significantly**. The way I achieved this was by **reducing the size of my team**.

In **2024, we had nine people** in total. Today, there are only **four of us left, including myself**. And the reason I could pull this off is **pretty simple**—I **replaced** my team members **with AI**.

In this video, I want to show you **the eight most high-impact AI tools** I use to run my **seven-figure SaaS business**, and **which areas of work they replaced**.

Every company is different, but for a **typical sales business**, you need to cover **four key areas of work**:
1. **Operations**
2. **Customer Support**
3. **Content Creation**
4. **Product Development**

Let’s get started.

---

## **1. AI Chat Assistants**
First, we need an **AI tool for direct interaction**. For a long time, the only real option was **ChatGPT from OpenAI**, but now we have **several strong alternatives**, including:

- **Claude** – Preferred by many founders I know.
- **DeepSeek** – Recently released, delivering impressive results.
- **Gemini** – Google's version of ChatGPT.
- **Llama** – An open-source alternative.

The **AI chat tool I use the most** is still **OpenAI’s ChatGPT**, but **Gemini is really strong for anything related to maps and location-based searches**.

The most **disappointing** tool for me has been **Claude**. I subscribed **twice last year**, and both times, I found it **underwhelming**—whether for **coding, content, or the overall quality of responses**.

One **major downside of ChatGPT** is **its pricing**. OpenAI now charges **$200/month**, which feels **too expensive** given how many great alternatives exist.

Instead of paying for ChatGPT’s **premium plan**, I use **OpenAI’s models directly** via **TypingMind**—a **chat UI that connects directly to my OpenAI account**.

This **gives me much more value** for my money.

---

## **2. AI-Powered Automation with n8n**
The next tool on my list is **n8n**, an **absolute game-changer** for **automation**.

n8n is in the same category as **Zapier** and **Make**, but it’s **far better** because:

- It allows you to **create advanced automations**.
- You can **jump into code anytime** for more flexibility.
- You can **set up API endpoints** easily using **drag-and-drop**.

One of **n8n's standout features** is its **AI agent system**.

You can **connect n8n to OpenAI** and **build your own AI team** by simply:
1. **Dragging in an AI agent node**
2. **Selecting a model and adding memory**
3. **Configuring tools for the agent**

This allows the **AI to autonomously complete tasks**—without needing to set up **complex conditional automation flows**.

It’s **totally mind-blowing**.

I'll be **talking more about this on my channel**, so if you **haven't subscribed yet**, you definitely should!

---

## **3. AI for Customer Support**
For **customer support**, you can either:

- **Use n8n to build a custom AI agent**.
- **Use a dedicated tool like 8Base** for **faster setup**.

**8Base** is an **AI-powered support system** that includes:
- AI training on your **website, PDFs, and YouTube videos**.
- A **customer support chatbot** for your website.
- A **knowledge base** for customer FAQs.
- A **ticketing and email-based support system**.

This makes **8Base** the perfect mix of **autonomous AI** and **human-led customer support**.

For **full transparency**, **8Base is a SaaS product my team built**. We believe it’s **one of the best customer support tools out there**, especially for **small and bootstrapped teams**.

Right now, **we’re offering lifetime access** as part of our **Founder Stack** bundle.

Check out **FounderStack.pro** for details.

---

## **4. AI for Content Creation**
For **image and video generation**, I use **Replicate**.

Replicate lets you **run and fine-tune AI models** like **Stable Diffusion and Flux** without worrying about GPU setup.

The model I use the most is **Flux**—which is **better than MidJourney or DALL·E**.

Replicate **automatically handles GPU resources** and lets me **fine-tune AI models**. For example, I trained **Flux on my own face** to generate **realistic AI thumbnails** for my videos.

---

## **5. AI for 3D and VFX**
Recently, I’ve **started using a lot of CGI and 3D elements** in my videos.

Instead of **hiring a VFX team**, I use:

- **Blender** for 3D modeling
- **ComfyUI** for advanced AI image processing
- **Soin-Depth** for turning 2D images into **3D environments**

This lets me create **realistic 3D backdrops** with minimal effort.

---

## **6. AI for Social Media Management**
For **social media automation**, I use **FeedHive**—an **AI-powered tool for managing and scheduling content**.

FeedHive lets me:
- **Schedule posts across all major platforms** (LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.).
- **Use an AI assistant** to improve engagement.
- **Predict post performance** using AI.

FeedHive **integrates with n8n**, making it **perfect for AI-driven content automation**.

Again, **full transparency—FeedHive is one of my SaaS products**.

Check out **FounderStack.pro** for details.

---

## **7. AI for Coding and Product Development**
For coding, I use **Cursor**—an **AI-powered VS Code alternative**.

Cursor helps by:
- **Autocompleting code** intelligently.
- **Predicting necessary edits** before you make them.
- **Allowing non-coders to generate full projects using natural language**.

If you're an experienced developer, **Cursor speeds up the workflow**. If you're a beginner, it can **generate full applications from scratch**.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
AI is **here to stay**, and it **can 10x your business—if you use it correctly**.

Now, let me show you **step-by-step how to use n8n and FeedHive** to automate content creation **for your brand**.

**Click here to watch the next video**, and I’ll see you there!

---

## **Bonus: AI in Business & Workato Use Case**
I also wanted to highlight **a case study from Bullhorn**, where **Ben Sommer**, Senior Director of Global Solutions & DevOps, explained **how Workato transformed their business operations**.

Previously, Bullhorn didn’t handle **integrations between their software and other business tools** due to the **complexity** involved.

After switching to **Workato**, they:
- **Reduced integration time from hundreds of hours to a few dozen**.
- **Standardized automation workflows**.
- **Eliminated technical debt** from custom-built integrations.

Workato has **become the backbone of their automation strategy**, helping Bullhorn scale efficiently.

---

## **AI Adoption Trends**
A recent **survey of 1,000 AI-adopting companies** found that:
- **Only 4-5%** have successfully deployed AI at **scale**.
- These companies see **1.5x to 2x higher growth rates** than others.

The lesson? **Waiting too long to adopt AI is like waiting until the Olympics to start training**—you'll **be too late**.

Welcome to **the new era of AI-powered automation**. Let’s embrace it.
