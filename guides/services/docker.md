# **Cap10Bill’s Docker Guide: Power Up Your Infrastructure**

## **Introduction to Docker**

Welcome to the world of **Docker**, the game-changing platform that allows you to **containerize** your applications and deploy them consistently across any environment. Whether you're a developer, systems administrator, or someone who just wants to get things done quickly — Docker is **your tool**.

### **Why Docker?**

Docker simplifies software delivery by:
- **Isolating environments**: It guarantees that your application works the same in any environment — whether it's your local machine, a staging server, or production.
- **Scaling**: Docker makes scaling applications **as simple as changing a number**.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run anywhere, from your laptop to the cloud.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight containers consume far less overhead than traditional virtual machines.

## **Getting Started with Docker**

First things first, let’s **get Docker installed**.

### **Installing Docker**

On **Ubuntu/Debian**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

For **CentOS/RHEL**:

```bash
sudo yum install docker
```

After installing, you’ll need to **start** Docker and ensure it runs on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Check if Docker is working:

```bash
sudo docker --version
```

## **Cap10Bill’s Quick Docker Concepts**

Before we dive into real use cases, here’s a quick rundown of **Docker concepts** you need to know:

- **Images**: The blueprints for containers. Think of them as snapshots of an application with all dependencies baked in.
- **Containers**: Running instances of Docker images. They are lightweight, isolated, and can be started or stopped with ease.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image (think of it like a recipe).
- **Volumes**: Docker's solution for persistent data. If you want your app to remember things after it’s stopped, you’ll need volumes.
- **Networks**: Docker manages container communication. Networks allow containers to talk to each other securely.

---

## **Setting Up Your First Docker Container**

Let's start by running a simple container. **Cap10Bill's approach**? No fluff, just results. Here’s the fastest way to get a container running:

### **Running a Simple Container**

Let’s run the official **Nginx** container (a popular web server) as an example:

```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nginx-container nginx
```

What this command does:
- `-d`: Run the container in the **background**.
- `-p 8080:80`: **Map port 8080** on your host to **port 80** inside the container.
- `--name nginx-container`: Name the container `nginx-container`.
- `nginx`: This is the **Docker image** we’re using.

Once the container is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser — you should see the **Nginx default page**.

---

## **Building Docker Images with Dockerfile**

Now, let’s **create our own Docker image**. **Dockerfiles** are how you **build** images from scratch. Here’s how to make a **custom Dockerfile** for a Node.js app.

### **Create a Dockerfile for a Node.js App**

1. Create your project directory:

```bash
mkdir node-docker-app
cd node-docker-app
```

2. Create a simple **Node.js app** (a `server.js` file):

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:8080/');
});
```

3. **Create your Dockerfile**:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Inside `Dockerfile`, add the following:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of your application
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

4. **Build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker build -t node-docker-app .
```

5. **Run the Docker container**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 node-docker-app
```

Now, visit `http://localhost:8080` and you should see the **Node.js app** running.

## **Docker Volumes: Keeping Your Data Safe**

Docker containers are **ephemeral** by default — meaning that when you stop or delete them, all the data inside them is lost. To fix this, you need **volumes**.

### **Creating and Using Docker Volumes**

Let’s say we’re running a **MySQL** container and we want to keep the database data even after the container is deleted.

1. **Run MySQL with a volume**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest
```

Explanation:
- `-v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql`: Create a volume called `mysql-data` and mount it to the MySQL container’s data directory.

2. **Back up the volume**:

If you want to back up the data inside a volume, you can run this:

```bash
docker run --rm -v mysql-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/mysql-backup.tar /data
```

3. **Restore the volume**:

```bash
docker run --rm -v mysql-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar xvf /backup/mysql-backup.tar -C /data
```

## **Docker Networks: Connecting Containers**

In more complex applications, you'll need to set up **Docker networks** to allow containers to communicate securely.

### **Creating a Docker Network**

1. **Create a custom bridge network**:

```bash
docker network create my-custom-network
```

2. **Run two containers and connect them to the network**:

```bash
docker run -d --name container1 --network my-custom-network nginx
docker run -d --name container2 --network my-custom-network nginx
```

3. **Check that the containers can communicate**:

Log into `container1`:

```bash
docker exec -it container1 bash
```

Ping `container2`:

```bash
ping container2
```

This will confirm that your containers are connected and can communicate via the custom network.

---

## **Scaling with Docker: Docker Compose**

Scaling services with Docker becomes incredibly easy using **Docker Compose**. It allows you to define and run multi-container applications.

### **Docker Compose Example: Nginx + Node.js**

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: nginx-container
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - webnet

  node-app:
    build: .
    container_name: node-app
    networks:
      - webnet

networks:
  webnet:
    driver: bridge
```

2. **Start your services**:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will spin up both **Nginx** and **Node.js** services, allowing Nginx to reverse proxy to the Node.js app.
