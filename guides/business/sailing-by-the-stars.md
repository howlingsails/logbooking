# Sailing by the Stars: A Practical Guide to Finding and Empowering Your Top Performers

In every organization, a few shining individuals help steer the ship toward success. These "stars" not only produce outstanding work but also inspire and guide the rest of the crew. This guide provides practical steps, activities, and templates to help you identify and empower these top performers, while also nurturing a positive, open environment for the entire team.

## Embracing the Power of Star Performers

Imagine a captain navigating a business armada, where each ship represents a different team or department. As a captain, you need to know your fellow captains and their crews, because collaboration across the fleet is essential to steer the armada toward success. In your own organization, these stars are the employees who consistently deliver excellence, drive innovation, and uplift their teammates. Their influence can raise the performance of the whole team, making your company hum with energy and achievement.

Focusing on your top performers means recognizing and celebrating what works well, while also identifying areas for improvement. It’s about finding pockets of brilliance, listening carefully to what these key players have to say, and building on that foundation to guide the entire crew.

## Creating a Safe Space for Open Dialogue

To harness the insights of your top performers, it’s essential to establish an environment where everyone feels safe to share their thoughts and experiences. While private tools exist for recording feedback, our approach encourages a mix of private reflection and open dialogue. This method helps employees think through their ideas using our framework—keeping emotion and process separate—before sharing their insights openly with the team.

Start by setting up ground rules that ensure confidentiality, respectful listening, and the use of neutral, factual language. This can be achieved through informal sessions or structured workshops, where a trained facilitator may guide the conversation to keep it focused and constructive.

## Guided Reflection Activities and Templates

Encourage your team to reflect on current processes and share ideas for improvement using a two-part template. This exercise helps employees separate factual observations from emotional responses, ensuring that discussions remain constructive.

### Template for Guided Reflection

*Part One – Process Description (Factual):*
- Describe the current process step by step.
- Identify specific actions or tasks.
- Note any measurable outcomes or observations.

*Part Two – Emotional Impact and Improvement Ideas:*
- Explain how this process makes you feel (e.g., frustrated, energized, hopeful).
- Envision the “dream state”: How would you like the process to work ideally?
- Suggest one or two ideas for improvement. What small changes might lead to big benefits?

After private reflection, invite team members to share their insights in a structured open dialogue. Use these guidelines during the sharing sessions:

- Begin by reinforcing that the goal is to share ideas—not assign blame.
- Ask clarifying questions like: “Can you explain more about how that step affects you?” or “What changes do you think would help the entire crew?”
- Encourage discussion around how shared insights can be turned into actionable steps.

## Finding Your Stars: Activities and Templates

### The Star Map Activity

Create a visual "star map" where employees highlight areas or teams that demonstrate exceptional performance. This collaborative board—physical or digital—allows team members to place a “star” sticker on departments, projects, or individuals they believe are leading the way.

**How to Run the Star Map Activity:**
- Present a clear overview of all teams and projects.
- Invite employees to add a star wherever they observe excellence.
- Facilitate a discussion where participants explain why they placed stars in those areas, helping to identify best practices and shared behaviors that contribute to high performance.

### Crew Roundtable Discussions

Host roundtable discussions that bring together a small, diverse group from across the organization. These conversations should focus on sharing experiences related to both the positive energy of star performers and opportunities for improvement.

**Discussion Prompts Include:**
- Describe a time when a team’s approach made work smoother and more enjoyable.
- What specific actions did that team take, and how did it impact your own work?
- How can these positive practices be spread across the organization?
- What challenges do you face with current processes, and what might be done to overcome them?

## Empowering Your Top Performers

Once you’ve identified your stars, empower them to lead the charge. Celebrate their success through public recognition, awards, or shout-outs in meetings and newsletters. Encourage these high performers to mentor others, share their insights, and offer suggestions for improvement across the board.

At the same time, be proactive about addressing any toxic behavior. Work with those individuals to help them open up and share more constructively, ensuring they understand the importance of collaboration and transparency. Provide targeted support through feedback, mentoring, and training to help them align with the team’s values.

## Working Together as an Armada

Remember, as a captain, you’re not alone in this journey. You’re part of a larger armada where knowing your fellow captains and their crews is key. Engage in regular communication and collaboration with other leaders to share best practices, resolve challenges, and support each other in driving the entire fleet toward a common goal. This network of trusted leaders and teams helps create a dynamic, high-performing organization where every ship contributes to the armada's success.
