# Business - Self Interview

### 1. The Digital Age Is Redefining Business

- **Outdated Systems vs. New Rules:**  
  Our society—and its education, employment, and economic systems—is largely built for the Industrial Revolution. Today’s digital age demands new mindsets and skills. Traditional careers, as taught in schools, no longer guarantee security;
  instead, building a personal brand and mastering digital business models is key. This also increases the value of automations of physical products through new technologies but also changing mindsets of what people want what used to work 
  doesn't consumerism and materialism and needs are always changing always flexing Of the ever present and ever changing Leaders of every type culture and subculture and counterculture 

- **Global Competition & Opportunity:**  
  With digital platforms, geographical boundaries are fading. Entrepreneurs can reach billions of potential customers, meaning competition is global—but so is the opportunity. The best businesses now are those that use digital tools to 
  scale quickly and effectively. However we see a change in what is a value and local is value knowing it is value how do you provide that value to your subculture or counterculture and where does it go and how does that work with your 
  competition. Boundaries of regulation and requirements written by people with no knowledge of implementation written to be interpreted by third party auditors that are part of the requirement to do business to take money from the ultra 
  rich they don't publish their numbers and makes Elon Musk seem like a average Joe with fancy car and some cool toys. For all wealth in the digital or industrial economy was created by the use of energy and for pulling stuff out of the 
  ground we give people money that they would want to spend on things so we must give them a reason to spend and ideas to spend. We have huge financial institutions with private money such as BlackRock and fidelity that hold money for 
  these people and huge pensions and they all are working together not in collusion but just in vested interest it's just naturally for them to work together help each other and build these new things as the leaders by ownership and money 
  build their dreams like lines in the sand or rebuilding little communities revitalizing things building new cities and new places where are those people the great people that make that happen. Build value in helping them bring their 
  vision to the world.

### 2. Learning by Doing: Entrepreneurial Apprenticeships & Side Hustles

- **Hands-On Experience Over Theory:**  
  Instead of jumping straight into launching a full-scale venture, the interview emphasizes learning by working in small teams under experienced entrepreneurs (an “entrepreneurial apprenticeship”).
- **Side Hustles as Testing Grounds:**  
  Short-term projects (e.g., 90-day side hustles) allow you to test ideas, learn from rapid cycles, and validate demand without massive risk. These practical experiments provide invaluable insights into what works—and what doesn’t.

---

### 3. Building a Personal Brand: Become a Key Person of Influence

- **Beyond Influencer Culture:**  
  It’s not about amassing millions of followers; it’s about establishing yourself as a trusted authority in your niche. A strong personal brand opens doors to capital, talent, and customers.

- **The Five Pillars of Branding:**
  - **Pitch:** Learn to communicate your story and vision clearly.
  - **Publish:** Consistently create content—whether tweets, videos, podcasts, or books—to refine ideas and gain feedback.
  - **Productize:** Package your expertise (e.g., through demos or digital products) so your time isn’t the only scalable asset.
  - **Profile:** Develop a polished, consistent online presence that resonates with your target audience.
  - **Partnerships:** Collaborate strategically to extend your reach and credibility.

- **The “7-Eleven” Principle:**  
  Aim to create enough “contact time” (e.g., 7 hours of content, 11 interactions, across 4 platforms) so that you become familiar—almost like a trusted friend—to your audience.

---

### 4. Differentiation in a Noisy Marketplace

- **Cutting Through the Noise:**  
  Human brains naturally filter out “bland” messages. Only certain messages stick:
  - **Scary:** Content that taps into genuine fears grabs attention.
  - **Strange:** Unusual or unexpected approaches make you memorable.
  - **Sexy:** A bold, attractive image or offer stands out.
  - **Free Value:** Delivering high-quality content or insights at no cost builds immediate trust.
  - **Familiarity:** Consistency creates parasocial relationships—people feel they “know” you after repeated exposure.

- **Packaging Matters:**  
  How you present free value (e.g., beautifully designed demos, assessments, or webinars) can dramatically affect perception and trust.

---

### 5. Testing, Validation & Productization

- **Demand Over Supply:**  
  Instead of over-planning the supply side (e.g., production details), start by testing market demand. Use:
  - **Productized Demos & Needs Analysis:** Package your offering into a demo or customer assessment to collect data and gauge interest.
  - **Assessments & Quizzes:** Turn customer surveys into interactive assessments that not only diagnose needs but also serve as engaging entry points for potential clients.

- **Segmentation Is Key:**  
  Understand that not all customers are equal. Focus on attracting the top 10% (or even top 1%) of your audience who have the capacity to pay premium prices and can drive exponential growth.

---

### 6. Leveraging Technology and AI

- **AI as the New Electricity:**  
  AI is in its early transformative phase and will revolutionize every industry. It can dramatically improve productivity—whether through enhanced data analysis, automated content creation, or smarter sales tools.

- **Up the Business Model Pyramid:**  
  Transition from being a skilled labor provider to building intellectual property (IP), creating media assets, capturing data, and developing software. Ultimately, your goal is to build scalable financial assets that generate value far beyond your personal time investment.

---

### 7. Sales, Pitching & Exponential Growth

- **Mastering the Pitch:**  
  Effective selling isn’t just about cold calls—it’s about crafting a compelling narrative that bridges your audience’s current reality with their desired future. A great pitch combines logical data, emotional storytelling, and a clear pathway to results.

- **The Power of Repetition:**  
  Consistency is critical. Repeated small improvements (the “1% mindset”) compound over time, much like doubling numbers in an exponential curve. Whether it’s publishing content daily or refining your pitch, every repetition moves you closer to breakthrough success.

- **Non-Linear Growth:**  
  As you refine your messaging and build momentum, expect growth to be exponential. The jump from thousands to millions (in subscribers, customers, or revenue) can happen when you combine a strong personal brand with an elegant, scalable business model.

---

### 8. Environment and Mindset

- **Surround Yourself with the Right People:**  
  Your performance is largely dictated by the environment you choose. Being around fellow entrepreneurs, content creators, and forward-thinking individuals can accelerate your progress.

- **Changing Your Environment:**  
  Whether it’s joining discussion groups, attending high-level events, or simply engaging with a new network online, actively seek environments that challenge and inspire you.

---

### 9. Health, Balance, and Long-Term Vision

- **Health Is Your Foundation:**  
  No matter how successful your business becomes, your health is paramount. One anecdote in the interview underscored that a wake-up call about health can shift your entire perspective—reminding you that a thriving business rests on a thriving you.

- **Work-Life Rhythm:**  
  Early in your career, you might set aggressive goals and work relentlessly. Over time, however, it’s crucial to slow down periodically—to reflect, appreciate the progress already made, and reorient your strategy for sustainable, long-term growth.

- **Commitment and Passion:**  
  Ultimately, the entrepreneurial journey is as much about mindset as it is about tactics. When you truly love what you do, remain resilient through setbacks, and commit to continuous learning and improvement, even the toughest challenges become stepping stones to success.

### Final Thoughts

For tech entrepreneurs and innovators using cap10.tech as a platform, the interview reinforces that today’s success isn’t about following old blueprints—it’s about embracing the digital revolution. Build a strong personal brand, iterate rapidly through testing and feedback, leverage cutting-edge technology (including AI), and always remain adaptable. By focusing on scalable systems and the power of genuine human connection (through consistent, valuable content), you can navigate this rapidly changing landscape and create long-term, exponential success.

---

This summary should provide cap10.tech users with a clear roadmap of how to think about modern entrepreneurship in the digital era, emphasizing both the mindset and the tactical frameworks needed to thrive.

**[7:51 AM – Interviewer]**  
It's extremely good at deleting messages. There are five things that my brain will not delete—and the last two are the most useful. The first is the thought: “I wish I knew this thing.” My career, and that of Daniel Priestley—the money-making expert and serial entrepreneur who has built several multi‑million‑dollar businesses from nothing—has been about mentoring over 3,500 businesses using the same frameworks for career success that you’re about to learn.

What we have now is a digital world, but all of society is still built for the Industrial Revolution. That means we’re governed by an alternate set of rules. Our schooling system is preparing us for a world that no longer exists. People feel that there are no opportunities, that there are no safe jobs anymore, and that they’re in competition with AI. This leaves an entire generation feeling absolutely wiped out before they even start.

So what are the new skills people need to succeed in the digital world? There’s a step-by-step refresh, including building a personal brand in ways that matter—because that’s the key to attracting capital, talent, and customers. It’s not about becoming an influencer with minions of followers; if you’re seen as a key person, that alone is enough to make seven figures. And that’s where the “five-piece” framework comes in. I’m going to take you through all of those elements, along with the entrepreneurial pyramid, which opens you up to a whole other world of opportunities, including side hustles and the two types of opportunities everyone needs to know about.

**[Interviewer]**  
How would you define and describe what it is you do with your content, your work, and through all the books you’ve published? What is the summary of what you do and who you do it for?

**[Guest]**  
I have a massive passion for entrepreneurship. About 20 years ago, I noticed a huge trend: entrepreneurs who could stand out, scale up, and make a positive impact on the world through business. Over the past two decades, I’ve built multiple businesses and observed the predictable stages people go through to achieve success. I started documenting what I learned in my books and built a community of entrepreneurs who wanted to take full advantage of our changing times.

What’s happening right now is comparable to the transition from the agricultural age to the Industrial Age. The agricultural age was a feudal system; the Industrial Age brought capitalism. Now, the Industrial Age is rapidly being replaced by the digital age—with entirely new rules emerging. In the old model, you had to gain skills, get a job, and find an employer. Today, success is about building a personal brand based on your unique “spectral property” and coupling that with a scalable, digital, elegant business model. Those who have figured this out are achieving incredible success at speed.

**[Interviewer]**  
I remember when you were running in Cape Town one day—you mentioned a young couple approached you after your run. Could you share that story?

**[Guest]**  
Yes. I was running around Cape Town for five days, and one morning around 1:00 when I stopped to read under a tree, a young couple (around 21 years old) approached me. They said, “Steve, we’ve been listening to your content for a while, but we’re just trying to figure out how to start a business and what we should be doing.” I could see in their faces that they’d been mulling it over for a long time. At that moment, I told them to listen to an episode I did with Daniel Priestley—and I mentioned that they’d soon be recording a show with him. For those of you in your early 20s feeling overwhelmed by this digital world, my advice is: do not try to become an entrepreneur immediately. Instead, start with an entrepreneurial apprenticeship.

Work in a small team (fewer than 12 people) with direct access to entrepreneurs who have built a personal brand and an elegant business model. Learn how they scale, communicate globally, and sell to people anywhere in the world. I started my career as a number two, working for a great mentor. We went from zero to six million in revenue in one year, growing from no team to 60 people. That’s the kind of real-world learning that prepares you for the journey ahead. Once you’ve learned the ropes, move on to side hustles and eventually launch your own venture.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
How do you know if you’re cut out for this? It seems like the signals get really jammed during times of disruption.

**[Guest]**  
Exactly. The rules are changing so fast that it’s hard to know if anyone is truly cut out for it. The signals are unclear during times of disruption. We’re all coming through a schooling system designed for a world of secure careers and safe jobs—one that no longer exists because AI and digital innovation are transforming everything. That’s why you need to reposition yourself for this new reality.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
When you mentioned the entrepreneurial apprenticeship, it sounded like a new form of education—a sort of modern university. Are there other ways to rapidly enhance your skills and knowledge to become an entrepreneur?

**[Guest]**  
Absolutely. While books, podcasts, and YouTube channels are great resources, nothing beats getting “on the bike.” You have to experience the process firsthand. The best thing is to work for someone who is already building a business. If that isn’t possible, partner with someone who has more experience than you, or launch small side hustles. For example, when I was younger, I organized nightclub parties by booking venues, promoting events, running the party, and then splitting the money at the end of the night. I also sold roses door-to-door for a brief Valentine’s Day campaign. These side hustles are designed to be open-and-shut experiments: you start, see what works, and then decide whether to build on that idea. They give you a chance to learn rapidly without locking you into long-term commitments.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Many entrepreneurs mention the importance of writing. You once said that writing was the biggest hack in your life. Could you explain why?

**[Guest]**  
Definitely. When I was 24, I made a commitment to write a tweet every day—and I even documented it on Instagram. This daily practice did three things for me:
1. It helped me build an audience of over two million followers on Instagram by consistently sharing my ideas.
2. It taught me how to communicate complex ideas in a concise, high-impact manner, so I quickly learned what resonated with people.
3. It forced me to distill my daily experiences into clear insights that otherwise would have passed me by.

Publishing, in any format—whether it’s tweets, videos, podcasts, or books—means putting your ideas into the public domain. You’re not just writing; you’re inviting feedback and adding value to others. Out of billions on platforms like LinkedIn or YouTube, only a small percentage publish regularly. That means if you start creating content consistently, you have a huge opportunity to stand out.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
So what’s your overall framework for accelerating your learning and building a business?

**[Guest]**  
My background is in running an agency where I constantly had to create quick reports and event content. In 2009, after the global financial crisis upended my business, I was forced to reexamine what I knew. I began writing about the strong truths I believed in and eventually wrote the book *Key Person of Influence* in 2009 (published in 2010). I was convinced that the future would see a shift from faceless, institutional brands to powerful personal brands. Today, when you see figures like Brian Cox, Richard Branson, or Elon Musk—with their personal brands often outweighing the institutions they represent—you realize how right that prediction was.

It’s about moving from being mere skilled labor, as taught in traditional education, to creating intellectual property and building a media presence that communicates your unique value to the world.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
For a young entrepreneur who feels stuck because of their geography—say, someone in Cape Town—what would be your advice to get started?

**[Guest]**  
Geography matters less today because the digital world erases borders. You can sell to anyone, anywhere. That said, if you’re starting out and feeling stuck, focus on getting real-world experience. If you can’t secure an apprenticeship, try to partner with someone more experienced or start with a side hustle. The key is to learn by doing rather than waiting for everything to be perfect.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Many people say that they’re not “cut out” for entrepreneurship because they feel invisible and lack a brand. How can they overcome that?

**[Guest]**  
The answer is to build a personal brand. And this isn’t about vanity or self-promotion in a shallow sense. It’s about becoming a key person of influence in your niche. You can do that by:
- **Pitching:** Learn to communicate your story, vision, and ideas clearly.
- **Publishing:** Consistently create content—whether that’s writing, videos, or podcasts—to refine your ideas and gain valuable feedback.
- **Productizing:** Package your expertise into scalable offerings (demos, digital products, or services) so you aren’t trading time for money every single time.
- **Building Your Profile:** Develop a consistent and professional online presence that tells people who you are and what you do.
- **Forming Partnerships:** Collaborate with others to expand your reach and credibility.

I call this the “five-piece” framework. When you combine these elements, you create what I refer to as a key person of influence. You don’t need millions of followers—just a dedicated, high-value audience that trusts you.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
What about differentiation? In such a noisy marketplace, how can someone stand out?

**[Guest]**  
Our brains naturally filter out messages that don’t stand out. Only certain types of content get remembered. For example, messages that are:
- **Scary:** Content that taps into genuine fears draws attention.
- **Strange:** Unusual, unexpected ideas are memorable.
- **Sexy:** Bold, attractive messaging makes an impact.
- **Free Value:** Offering something valuable for free builds trust instantly.
- **Familiarity:** Consistent exposure over time creates strong, almost personal connections.

It’s important to package your free value in a way that looks polished and professional—if you hand someone a beautiful gift box instead of something that looks cheap, they’ll perceive the value to be much higher. This is how you overcome the noise and make your message stick.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Let’s talk about launching products. How do you test and validate an idea before you commit fully?

**[Guest]**  
You want to focus on testing demand rather than getting stuck in supply details. One effective method is to “productize” your demo along with a customer needs analysis. For instance, if you’re launching a new coffee brand, rather than spending months securing bottling agreements and sourcing fruit, you should first present your concept to potential buyers—maybe via a 15‑minute or one‑hour demo. Collect data, run a survey, or even launch an assessment (like an interactive quiz) to gauge interest. This approach lets you see if there’s real demand without investing too much upfront.

Additionally, digital platforms like Facebook allow you to run multiple ad variations to test ideas quickly and cheaply. I once ran ads testing 70 different book titles to see which one resonated best with my audience—the conversion rates varied dramatically, and that data helped me decide which title to pursue further.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Repetition seems to be a recurring theme in your approach. Why is consistency so important?

**[Guest]**  
Repetition is everything. Think about it—how many times have you listened to your favorite song? Every repetition builds familiarity, and with business, that same principle applies. Whether it’s publishing content daily or practicing your pitch, each small step compounds over time. In my experience, the early efforts might seem small, but they set the stage for exponential growth. Once you hit a breakthrough, everything doubles—much like exponential growth in mathematics. The key is to commit to that “1% mindset” and focus on making tiny improvements every day.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
There’s also the topic of environment. How does your environment affect your performance?

**[Guest]**  
Environment is critical—it dictates performance. The people you surround yourself with and the spaces you inhabit shape your behavior and mindset. If you’re in an environment where everyone is pushing forward, innovating, and scaling businesses, you’ll start to see those practices as normal. Conversely, if you’re in an environment where negativity or outdated beliefs prevail, progress will feel much harder.

Even simple changes can help—for instance, going to a high-rise café with a view of the city can shift your perspective, or meeting with someone who’s a few steps ahead in your journey can provide a fresh boost of inspiration. Surround yourself with people who challenge you, support you, and are focused on growth.

---

**[Interviewer]**  
Lastly, let’s address health and balance. How do you view the relationship between health, optimization, and pleasure in your life?

**[Guest]**  
This is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned. Not long ago, on Christmas Eve, my doctor called me about a lab result—one of my enzyme levels was elevated, suggesting I was close to a health problem. It was a wake-up call. For that week, I experienced what it feels like to be at risk of losing my health. When you face that reality, you suddenly understand how much you take your body for granted.

It reminded me that while we chase business success, our health is our foundation. A healthy body is essential for enjoying life’s pleasures and achieving long-term goals. Optimizing your health can actually lead to greater pleasure, and no business or achievement means anything if you don’t have your health in check.

---

**[Interviewer – Closing]**  
Thank you so much for sharing these insights. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts for those just starting out—perhaps 21-year-olds looking to build their brand and business in this digital age?

**[Guest]**  
The big opportunity today is to build a strong personal brand and attach it to an elegant, scalable business model. It’s not necessary to amass millions of followers; even a modest, high-value audience of five to fifty thousand is enough if you’re seen as a key person of influence. Focus on pitching, publishing, productizing your expertise, building your profile, and forming strategic partnerships. That’s how you generate capital, attract talent, and secure customers.

I also encourage everyone not to get distracted by what’s happening on the horizon. Often, we overlook the value we already have because we’re too focused on what we don’t have. Recognize the “mountain” you’re already standing on and build from there.

Remember, consistency is key—every small action counts, and over time, those small wins compound into exponential success.
