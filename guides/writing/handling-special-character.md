Below is a concise guide with a table of common UTF‑8 keyboard and computer symbols. The table includes each symbol’s Unicode codepoint and quick instructions on how to type or access them on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Many of these symbols are built into the physical keyboards of their respective platforms (for example, the Command (⌘) and Option (⌥) keys on Macs or the Windows key on PCs), while others—such as ©, ®, and ™—can be inserted using alt codes, option combinations, or Compose key sequences.

This table is a handy reference for quickly accessing or describing key symbols and common computer-related characters when writing technical documentation or tutorials.

Below is a guide on how to access and insert special characters using built-in tools on Windows, macOS, and Linux. These methods work regardless of your editor or application.



---

## Windows

- **Character Map Application:**
  - **Method:** Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog, type `charmap`, and press Enter.
  - **Alternative:** Search for "Character Map" in the Start menu.
- **Alt Codes:**
  - **Method:** Hold down the **Alt** key and type the numeric code (using the numeric keypad) for the desired symbol (e.g., Alt + 0169 for ©).

## macOS

- **Character Viewer (Emoji & Symbols):**
  - **Method:** Press `Control + Command + Space` to open the Character Viewer.
  - **Alternative:** In many applications, use the “Edit” menu and select “Emoji & Symbols.”
- **Menu Bar Access:**
  - **Method:** Enable the Character Viewer in System Preferences so that it appears in your menu bar for quick access.

## Linux

- **Character Map Application:**
  - **GNOME:** Look for **Gucharmap** in your application menu or press `Alt+F2`, type `gucharmap`, and press Enter.
  - **Other Desktop Environments:** Search for “Character Map” or “Unicode Character Selector.”
- **Compose Key:**
  - **Method:** Configure a Compose key (e.g., the Right Alt key) in your system settings. Once set up, you can type multi-key sequences (like Compose, `c`, `,`) to produce symbols like ©.
