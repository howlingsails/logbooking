**cap10bill** (calling the bridge crew to order): Ahoy, mates—let’s gather the Cap10.Tech staff for an informal round-table on cultural values.  We want to learn how each of us can use these lenses to better understand ourselves, our families, and our customers.

---

**cap10.simon** (navigating purpose): When I think about cultural values, I see them as compasses for our motivations.  If we map our own “true north,” we understand why we make choices—and how our loved ones or clients might orient differently.

**cap10.naval** (long-term strategist): And these compasses shift by culture.  In some places, the needle points toward collective harmony; in others, it’s all about individual flair.  By recognizing that, we can chart better courses with our teams and customers.

**cap10.jeremy** (persuasion navigator): For persuasion and empathy, knowing whether someone prizes community first or personal achievement matters.  It helps us frame messages in terms they truly value—family legacy, career milestones, or social belonging.

**cap10.tim** (productivity officer): On a personal level, I use these values to set routines.  If I’m naturally risk-averse, I schedule small experiments instead of giant leaps.  If I lean into structure and hierarchy, I’ll design checklists; if I’m egalitarian, I’ll crowdsource ideas.

**cap10.bill** (your captain): And with our families?  Recognize when a loved one honors tradition—invite them to share stories—versus when they crave novelty, so you can plan experiences that resonate.

## Key Cultural Values and How to Reframe Them Across Cultures

Below is a shared value, its meaning, and a quick tip on reframing when you cross cultural waters.

**Individualism**
Describes how much a person prioritizes personal goals, independence, and self-expression.
•  In some cultures (like the U.S.), “standing out” and pursuing individual dreams is celebrated.
•  In others (e.g. Japan, Mexico), people see themselves first as part of a group—family, team, community.

> **Reframe tip:** When speaking to a collectivist-leaning individual, emphasize how their success uplifts the whole team or family, rather than only their personal gain.

**Collectivism**
Focuses on group harmony, shared responsibility, and loyalty to community or family.
•  Gatherings, consensus-building, and group decisions are hallmarks.
•  The flip side can feel stifling to a strongly individualistic person.

> **Reframe tip:** If you’re from a high-collectivism culture working with a fiercely individualistic customer, highlight how collaboration still empowers each person’s unique contribution.

**Respect for Authority (Power Distance)**
Measures comfort with hierarchy and deference to status.
•  High power-distance cultures expect clear rank and formal titles (e.g. many Asian or Latin American contexts).
•  Low power-distance cultures favor flat teams and open debate (e.g. many Western startups).

> **Reframe tip:** If your customer comes from a high authority culture, present ideas through an endorsed champion or clear senior sponsor.  In low power-distance settings, invite everyone to the table for feedback.

**Work Ethic & Ambition**
Reflects attitudes toward hard work, career goals, and what success means.
•  Some view success as personal achievement and social status.
•  Others measure success by group well-being or life balance.

> **Reframe tip:** Ask how they define “making it.”  Is it the promotion and title, or free time to recharge?  Use their language of achievement to propose solutions.

**Uncertainty Avoidance (Risk Tolerance)**
Captures comfort with ambiguity and change.
•  High uncertainty avoidance cultures prefer rules, plans, and predictability (e.g. Germany, Japan).
•  Low-avoidance cultures welcome experimentation and pivoting (e.g. Silicon Valley).

> **Reframe tip:** For a risk-averse stakeholder, present detailed roadmaps and safety nets.  For a risk-tolerant one, highlight innovation and “move-fast” scenarios.

**Time Orientation**
Shows whether people focus on past traditions, present enjoyment, or future planning.
•  Past-oriented cultures emphasize heritage and precedents.
•  Present-focused value spontaneity and immediate relationships.
•  Future-oriented look to long-term goals and investments.

> **Reframe tip:** If your audience prizes tradition, anchor your message in success stories or legacy achievements.  If they’re future-oriented, stress growth trajectories and projections.

**Tradition vs. Innovation**
Balances honoring heritage against embracing new ideas.
•  Tradition-leaning cultures may resist change, valuing stability.
•  Innovation-driven cultures celebrate disruption and novel solutions.

> **Reframe tip:** Pair your innovative proposal with respect for what’s worked historically (“Building on your strong foundation, here’s an evolution”).

**Directness vs. Indirectness**
Refers to how people communicate disagreeing or negative feedback.
•  Direct communicators say what they think up front (common in many Western contexts).
•  Indirect communicators use nuance, context, or mediation to avoid offence (common in East Asia, parts of Latin America).

> **Reframe tip:** With indirect communicators, read between the lines and ask open-ended follow-up questions to clarify.  With direct speakers, be transparent and concise.

**Emotional Expression vs. Restraint**
Tracks whether showing feelings openly is normal or discouraged.
•  Expressive cultures encourage visible joy or frustration.
•  Reserved cultures maintain composure and avoid public displays of emotion.

> **Reframe tip:** If your colleague is more restrained, match their tone and look for subtle cues (tone of voice, pauses).  If they’re expressive, respond with warmth and energy.

**Community & Inclusion**
Values around diversity, equity, and belonging.
•  Some cultures actively celebrate differences and pluralism.
•  Others have more homogeneous social fabric and may be less accustomed to overt inclusion initiatives.

> **Reframe tip:** When introducing inclusive practices, frame them in terms of shared success and broader talent pools for homogeneous groups.

**Interpersonal Boundaries & Personal Space**
Different norms on privacy, proximity, and self-disclosure.
•  Some cultures hug and stand close, share personal stories freely.
•  Others maintain physical and emotional distance.

> **Reframe tip:** Mirror their comfort level in meetings—if they lean in, reciprocate.  If they step back, give them room and let them open up at their own pace.

**Spiritual & Religious Orientation**
The role of faith and ritual in daily life.
•  Religiously oriented cultures may integrate spiritual language in decisions.
•  Secular cultures separate business from spiritual life.

> **Reframe tip:** Respect religious rhythms (holidays, prayer times) and, when appropriate, honor their beliefs in framing timelines or values statements.

### How to Apply This Guide

1. **Spot the Clues**
   Listen for key phrases (“I built this myself,” “we all worked together,” “this never fails,” etc.) and watch body language (enthusiasm vs. restraint).  Check how people talk about “we” vs. “I,” and whether they defer to senior voices.

2. **Frame Your Message**
   Choose the value most likely to resonate.  If you’re pitching a new tool to a high-PDI audience, lead with how leadership already endorses it.  If you’re addressing a collectivist group, underscore shared gains.

3. **Adapt Across Cultures**
   When crossing cultural lines:

  * **Individualism ↔ Collectivism:** Recast “your advantage” as “our advantage.”
  * **Competition ↔ Collaboration:** Present contests as team challenges rather than solo races.
  * **Innovation ↔ Tradition:** Show how your novel idea is the next chapter in a proud legacy.

4. **Reflect in Your Team**
   Run a workshop: have each member identify which value they most naturally speak, then practice reframing it for a different subculture.  Over time you’ll build cultural agility.

5. **Measure & Iterate**
   Collect feedback: Did emphasizing community help win hearts in a collectivist team?  Did direct communication close deals faster with Western partners?  Track outcomes and refine your framing.

By classifying these core U.S. values across subcultures and knowing how to reframe them, each of us in the Cap10.Tech Armada can steer communications, product designs and relationships with greater cultural intelligence—making sure our messages always find fair winds in every port of call.
