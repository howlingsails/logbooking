>
>- **Insanity:** Repeating the same debugging steps for a recurring error, expecting a different outcome—when the issue is actually due to subtle environmental changes or overlooked dependencies.
>- **Madness:** Making a minor configuration change on one server and getting a different result on another due to slight version discrepancies—a common, realistic scenario in heterogeneous IT environments.

>
>**Guiding Philosophies:**
>
>- **Prioritize Effectiveness Over Busyness:** Focus on what truly moves the needle rather than just staying occupied.
