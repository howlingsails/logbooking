Cap10.Armada Company Guide

Manifesto: Why We Sail

> "You are the captain of your own ship. But you're not alone. You're part of an armada—independent leaders aligned in shared mission."



Cap10.Tech is more than a company. It’s a fleet of creators, technologists, and thinkers building real-world solutions powered by clarity, integrity, and evolution.

We don’t worship busywork. We don’t play corporate theater. We build.
We document.
We ship.
We improve.
We lead.

The Cap10.Armada was founded to bring this spirit to life across every project, client, platform, and product we touch.

This guide is for:

Internal captains charting their path inside Cap10.Tech

External collaborators looking to join our fleet

Clients who want to work not with vendors, but partners


Our promise: This isn’t fluff. Every section ends in action. Every ideal is grounded in real practice. You’ll know what to do, what to look for, and how to course-correct — in any sea.

The 5 Foundational Orders of the Cap10.Armada

These aren’t corporate values carved into marble. They’re sea-worn principles — tested in client storms, product pivots, and late-night code rewrites. If you follow these, you’ll steer straight. If you stray, you’ll feel the drift.

Order: Log or Lose It

> “If it’s not logged, it didn’t happen.”



Documentation is sacred. It’s our shared memory, our training manual, our audit trail, our launchpad. Every idea, decision, fix, or failure must be captured — so others can learn, build, and improve from it.

Practices:

All meetings end with documented decisions.

Recipes, configs, checklists, and gotchas live in the repo or knowledge base.

Write before you ask. Search before you ask. Log after you answer.



---

Order: Lead as Captain, Serve as Crew

> “Everyone owns the ship. Everyone swabs the deck.”



Titles don’t determine leadership — contribution does. You’re expected to think like a captain and act like a crew member, in the same breath. Lead with initiative. Serve with humility.

Practices:

Speak up early when the course feels off.

Ask for help before it becomes failure.

Take responsibility beyond your role.



---

Order: Bias Toward Action

> “Small ships beat big plans.”



We move fast, but we don’t move recklessly. We favor momentum over perfection. We prototype, we test, we learn. No endless meetings. No deck-spinning.

Practices:

Start small. Ship often. Course-correct.

Propose, don’t pontificate.

If you can do it in 2 minutes, do it now.



---

Order: Challenge, Don’t Comply

> “Agreement is easy. Clarity is earned through challenge.”



Complacency kills ships. Your job isn’t to nod along — it’s to ask the hard questions, especially when you agree. We’re a culture of respectful confrontation, not silent approval.

Practices:

Every major decision needs a devil’s advocate.

Say “I’m not convinced yet…” as a gift, not a threat.

Invite pushback early in every proposal.



---

Order: Purpose Over Process

> “We’re not here to follow templates. We’re here to make things that matter.”



If a process helps the mission, we honor it. If it doesn’t, we evolve it. Tools, rituals, systems — they’re only as good as the clarity and progress they create.

Practices:

Question the way it’s always been done.

Track the purpose behind every recurring meeting.

Automate what drains energy. Focus on what drives value.
