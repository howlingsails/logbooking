Below is a step-by-step method that uses LinkedIn as a research tool to map out the skills needed for your target positions over different time horizons, along with a system for tracking and prioritizing your own skill development.

## 1. Define Your Career Timeline & Goals

**Set Your Milestones:**
- **1-Year Goal:** The immediate role or entry-level position you’d like to secure.
- **3-Year Goal:** A mid-level position with increased responsibilities.
- **5-Year Goal:** A senior or specialized role where you lead projects or teams.
- **10-Year Goal:** A high-level executive or subject-matter expert position.

*Tip:* Write down the job titles and descriptions you find inspiring for each milestone.

## 2. LinkedIn “Stalking” – Researching Profiles

**Search for Target Roles:**
- Use LinkedIn’s search with filters for location, industry, and current position to find professionals who hold the positions you want at each career milestone.
- Save or note several profiles for each time frame (1, 3, 5, and 10 years).

**Extract Skills and Attributes:**
- **Soft Skills:** Look for recurring mentions like communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, and time management.
- **Hard Skills:** Identify specific technical or specialized knowledge—data analysis, forensic techniques, digital tools, etc.
- **Tools & Techniques:** Note any software, hardware, equipment, or methodologies they frequently reference (e.g., 3D scanning, digital imaging, forensic software platforms).

*Tip:* Use LinkedIn’s “Skills & Endorsements” section along with job descriptions and recommendations for insights.

## 3. Compile a Master Skill List

**Create a Spreadsheet or Logbook:**  
Include columns for:
- **Skill Name**
- **Category:** Soft Skill, Hard Skill, Tool/Technique
- **Relevance:** Indicate the timeline(s) it appears in (1, 3, 5, 10 years)
- **Frequency:** How often you see it among target profiles
- **Notes/Examples:** Any context or resources mentioned by professionals

*Example Logbook Entry:*

| Skill            | Category  | Target Timeline | Frequency | Notes/Examples                         |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Digital Imaging  | Hard Skill| 1, 3            | High      | Used in crime scene reconstructions    |
| Leadership       | Soft Skill| 3, 5, 10        | Medium    | Endorsed in recommendations            |
| 3D Scanning      | Tool/Technique | 1, 3      | High      | Common in advanced CSI roles           |

## 4. Prioritize Skills for Immediate Focus

**Rank the Skills:**
- **Primary Focus (1 & 3 Years):** These are your immediate “must-haves” for advancing to your near-term goals.
- **Secondary Focus (5 & 10 Years):** Keep these in mind as long-term objectives, but they might not need immediate attention.

**Select 3 Skills to Develop:**
- **Short-Term Skills (2):** Choose two skills that are relatively quick to learn or improve. For example, a software tool or a soft skill like communication.
- **Long-Term Skill (1):** Pick one complex skill that requires more in-depth study or practical experience—such as mastering advanced forensic technology or leadership in forensic project management.

*Tip:* Choose skills that not only appear frequently in your research but also complement each other for building a robust foundation.

## 5. Develop a 90-Day Skill-Building Plan

**Timeframe & Commitment:**
- **Duration:** 90 days
- **Diligent Practice:** Dedicate at least 4 hours of focused, quality time per selected skill (this might be spread out or in concentrated sessions).

**Plan Outline:**
1. **Define Learning Objectives:**
  - What does “proficiency” look like for each skill?
  - Identify specific milestones (e.g., complete an online course, build a mini-project, participate in a workshop).

2. **Identify Resources:**
  - **Online Courses:** Platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udemy
  - **Workshops & Webinars:** Look for events hosted by forensic or tech organizations
  - **Mentorship & Peer Groups:** Engage with LinkedIn groups or local networking events

3. **Set Weekly/Daily Goals:**
  - Break the 90-day period into weekly targets (e.g., “This week, complete Module 1 of the course on [Skill X]”).

4. **Record Your Progress:**
  - Use your logbook to record time spent, resources used, and reflections on your progress.
  - Note any challenges and successes to determine if you’re moving in the right direction.

5. **Re-Evaluation:**
  - After 90 days or once you’ve invested 4 hours of dedicated practice per skill, reassess.
  - Ask: Am I gaining the expected competence? Should I adjust my focus or continue further?

*Example Logbook Entry for a Skill:*

| Date       | Skill         | Time Spent | Activity/Resource         | Progress Notes                     |
|------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2025-04-01 | Digital Imaging | 1 hour   | Completed online tutorial | Understood basics, need more practice |
| 2025-04-08 | Digital Imaging | 1 hour   | Practiced on sample cases | Improved image analysis techniques  |

## 6. Confirming the Right Direction

- **Set Checkpoints:** At the end of 90 days, review your logbook entries and self-assessment.
- **Gather Feedback:** If possible, seek feedback from mentors or professionals in your network.
- **Adjust Plan if Needed:** If you find that a selected skill isn’t as beneficial or you’re progressing faster/slower than expected, revise your targets or resource allocations.

*Final Note:* This method not only helps you identify the right skills by “stalking” LinkedIn profiles ethically but also builds a structured approach to developing and tracking your progress. The iterative nature of the logbook and evaluation ensures you’re always aligned with your career goals.

This approach should provide you with a clear, actionable path to building the skills needed for your desired roles while keeping your short-term and mid-term goals in focus.
