### **CAP10BILL'S LOG: MONDAY MADNESS & THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE**

Ahoy, crew. Gather ‘round. I’ve got a tale—one that’ll chill your circuits and put dread in the heart of any Dev, DevOps, or IT captain who's dared to set sail into the workweek unprepared.

You see, landlubbers talk about the **Bermuda Triangle**—that infamous stretch of ocean where **planes vanish, ships disappear, and the laws of physics take coffee breaks**. Some say it’s electromagnetic anomalies, rogue waves, or even underwater alien bases sucking things into the abyss. Others whisper about time warps, parallel dimensions, or ancient curses left behind by the **great sysadmins of Atlantis**.

Now, I’m not here to argue with historians, scientists, or conspiracy theorists. No, no, no.

I *believe* in the Bermuda Triangle… because **anyone who’s worked in Dev, DevOps, or IT knows it’s real.**

Only, it doesn’t just exist in the Atlantic Ocean. **It exists in every company, in every infrastructure, and without fail—every Monday morning.**

**Ask any engineer.** The exact same deployment that worked **on Friday**? Dead on arrival Monday.  
The database, untouched all weekend? **Locked tighter than Fort Knox.**  
The API requests that went through flawlessly **yesterday**? Now lost in an interdimensional void.

I’ve sailed these waters. I’ve seen it firsthand.  
I’ve watched innocent engineers walk in, coffee in hand, only to be met with **incidents that defy logic, mocks that refuse to mock, and environments that rewrite themselves like haunted codebases.**

Now, some say these are just bugs, misconfigurations, or overlooked changes.  
But we—**the brave souls who live this madness every week**—we know better.

And if you doubt me, well… just wait until next Monday.
