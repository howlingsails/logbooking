Hello [Vendor Name],

I hope you’re well.

We are in the process of developing a high-performance, build-to-order workstation designed for advanced AI automation and high‑FPS gaming. We’re seeking a Request for Quote (RFQ) for an initial production run of two prototype systems, with plans to sell five units in the first quarter and scale to approximately 25 units over the year—with potential for much larger volumes.

Below are the full target specifications for the prototypes:

- **CPU:**
  - AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16 cores/32 threads)

- **GPUs:**
  - Dual Nvidia RTX 5090

- **Motherboard:**
  - ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E (or equivalent with robust power delivery and ample PCIe lanes)

- **Memory:**
  - 256GB DDR5 (e.g., Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 5200MHz)

- **Primary Storage:**
  - Samsung 990 Pro 4TB NVMe SSD

- **Bulk Storage:**
  - Dual 10TB Western Digital Red Pro drives in a mirrored configuration

- **RAID Expansion:**
  - HighPoint SSD7101A‑1 NVMe RAID Controller (to support 4 additional NVMe SSDs configured in RAID 10)

- **Cooling:**
  - Custom water‑cooling loop that includes:
    - Dedicated water blocks for the CPU and both GPUs
    - An oversized reservoir for enhanced coolant capacity and thermal stability
    - A high‑capacity radiator setup (360–480mm with extra radiator fans)

- **Power Supply & Chassis:**
  - EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 T2 PSU
  - Full‑tower case (such as a Lian Li PC‑O11 Dynamic XL or equivalent) for ample space and optimized airflow

- **Additional Components:**
  - High‑quality thermal paste
  - Pre‑configured software environment (Windows 11 Pro with our proprietary AI/automation stack)

We are very open to your recommendations. Your expertise on component selection, warranty terms, and post‑deployment support is highly valued to ensure we achieve optimal performance and reliability.

Could you please provide:
- A quote for the two prototypes (including warranty and support options)
- Your suggestions on the hardware configuration or any improvements to these specs
- Volume pricing details for an anticipated run of 25 units over the next year (with potential for larger volumes)

We believe this project offers a strong opportunity for a mutually beneficial partnership. I look forward to discussing this further and hearing your insights.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
