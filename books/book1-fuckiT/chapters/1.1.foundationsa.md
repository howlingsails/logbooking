Imagine standing in front of a giant building made of steel beams, glass panels, and miles of wiring. You see architects, electricians, plumbers, and engineers, all running around trying to make sure the building is not only safe but also comfortable to live or work in. That’s sort of how it feels when people talk about information technology systems, from the smallest mom-and-pop store with a point-of-sale machine and QuickBooks to a massive corporation running sprawling data centers across the globe.

It can help to think of every software application or network of applications as a structure built on layers. There’s the foundation—the operating system—that holds everything up, a bit like the concrete slab under a building. Then you have walls and floors, which are your applications and services. You have an electrical system, which might be your security scans, regulatory compliance checks, and deployment pipelines. Every piece has to fit together properly. Netflix, for example, has a massive building of technology hidden in the background. All we see is a menu of shows, but behind the scenes they’ve got servers that figure out which movie to send, where to store your preferences, and how to deliver it all quickly. Now take that same complexity and throw it into, say, a hospital. Instead of picking your favorite TV show, you’re trying to update patient records under serious government rules, with audits and checks at every turn.

These systems are never the same, even if they look alike from a distance. You might visit the same company a year later and discover everything’s changed—new regulations, new versions of software, and brand-new “magic strings” for naming files or directories. But that’s why it’s such a fascinating and lucrative industry. There’s real value in knowing how to build and maintain these digital buildings, in part because we’re dealing with the world’s money, private and public. All sorts of people need to get paid, data needs to be tracked, and the law needs to be followed. Someone has to make sure it all runs smoothly.

The great thing is we can automate a lot of this, but automation only works well when we record and refine what we learn. That’s where good logging and documentation come in. The best place to write documentation is often right inside your code, so that when you look at a function or a script, it tells you exactly how it works and why it exists. A bit like an architect leaving detailed notes on the blueprint, rather than scribbling them on a separate piece of paper that gets lost. I admit I sometimes slip up on that diligence. I’ll troubleshoot a problem for hours, fix it, and then forget to document it because I’m already rushing off to the next challenge. But every time I do take the time to write it down, future me is grateful.

My YouTube playlists show just how broad my interests are: leadership talks, biology animations, coding tutorials, and even chill music for those times I need to concentrate or unwind. I’ve learned so much by following these topics religiously. It reminds me that all these seemingly unrelated fields—mechanical engineering, software deployment, healthcare apps, or streaming services—share a common thread: they’re all about building, maintaining, and improving complex systems. Whether you’re hooking up a water line in a high-rise, configuring a Linux server, or rolling out a new version of a web application through CI/CD, the mindset is the same. Lay down a plan, follow the steps, use the right tools, keep everything safe, and make sure it all works together without blowing up the rest of the building.

That’s the story I want to tell here. I want to bridge the gap between people who’ve only seen computers as black boxes and people who’ve been neck-deep in code for years. There’s always more to learn, more processes to automate, more logs to keep, and more random details to wrangle. But if we treat each new task like a fresh blueprint, we can build and rebuild with confidence—and maybe even a bit of fun. After all, these systems might look intimidating, but at the end of the day, they’re just big, evolving constructions waiting for the right person to piece them all together.
