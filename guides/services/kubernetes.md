## **Part 1: Introduction to Kubernetes â€” What is Kubernetes? Why Do You Need It?**

### **What is Kubernetes?**

![img.png](_images/container-orchestration.png)

Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform** that allows you to deploy, manage, and scale applications automatically. It enables developers to focus on building applications while Kubernetes handles the complexity of scaling, 
networking, and deployment.

It works primarily with **Docker** containers, but also supports other container runtimes such as **containerd** and **CRI-O**.

### **Why Kubernetes?**

Here are some reasons why Kubernetes is essential in modern cloud-native environments:

1. **Scalability**: Kubernetes automatically scales applications to meet demand. You define how many replicas of an application you need, and Kubernetes will ensure the correct number of instances are running at all times.

2. **High Availability**: Kubernetes ensures that if a container or pod fails, it will automatically restart or reschedule it, ensuring minimal downtime for applications.

3. **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes can automatically replace failed containers and ensure your app is always up and running.

4. **Portability**: Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, making it easy to deploy containers across any environment (cloud, on-premises, hybrid).

5. **Automation**: Kubernetes automates many aspects of deployment, including **load balancing**, **rollouts**, **rollbacks**, and **configuration management**.

### **Kubernetes Components**

- **Pods**: The smallest unit of deployment. A pod is a group of containers running on the same host, sharing storage and networking resources.
- **Nodes**: Virtual or physical machines that make up the Kubernetes cluster. They host the pods.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that run Kubernetes-managed applications.
- **Control Plane**: The control plane manages the Kubernetes cluster, responsible for maintaining the desired state of applications. It includes components like the **API server**, **scheduler**, **controller manager**, and **etcd**.

## **Part 2: Setting up Kubernetes â€” Installation and Cluster Setup**

In this section, we'll explore how to **install Kubernetes** and set up a **Kubernetes cluster**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up Kubernetes with Minikube (Single-node Cluster)**

For beginners or for development purposes, setting up a **local Kubernetes environment** is easy with **Minikube**. Minikube runs a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine (using a VM or Docker container).

1. **Install Minikube**:

  - **For macOS** (via Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install minikube
    ```

  - **For Windows** (via Chocolatey):
    ```bash
    choco install minikube
    ```

  - **For Linux** (via curl):
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minikube
    ```

2. **Start Minikube**:
   To start your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

   Minikube will automatically download the necessary images and start a virtual machine running a Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Access Kubernetes Dashboard**:
   Minikube comes with a built-in dashboard that lets you manage and visualize your cluster.
   ```bash
   minikube dashboard
   ```

   This will open a web interface where you can monitor your cluster's health, resources, and pods.

### **Step 2: Setting Up Kubernetes with kubeadm (Multi-node Cluster)**

For more complex environments, you can use **kubeadm** to set up a **multi-node Kubernetes cluster**. This is typically used for production setups.

1. **Install kubeadm on all nodes**:
   Follow the installation guide from the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/).

2. **Initialize the Master Node**:
   On the master node, run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo kubeadm init
   ```

   This will initialize the control plane and give you a **token** to join worker nodes to the cluster.

3. **Set Up kubectl on Master Node**:
   After the `kubeadm init` command completes, set up `kubectl` (the command-line tool to interact with the cluster) on the master node:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
   ```

4. **Join Worker Nodes**:
   Use the **token** provided during `kubeadm init` to join worker nodes to the cluster:
   ```bash
   kubeadm join <master-node-ip>:6443 --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
   ```

5. **Verify the Cluster**:
   Run the following command on the master node to check the cluster status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

## **Part 3: Understanding Kubernetes Architecture â€” Pods, Nodes, and Clusters**

### **Kubernetes Architecture Overview**

Kubernetes is designed to be a **highly available** system. Its architecture consists of multiple layers that work together to manage your containers and applications effectively.

1. **Control Plane**:
  - **API Server**: The entry point for all Kubernetes API calls, which is responsible for managing the state of the cluster.
  - **Scheduler**: Assigns work to nodes based on resource availability.
  - **Controller Manager**: Ensures that the desired state of the system is maintained by checking and managing Kubernetes components.
  - **etcd**: A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data (like configuration and state).
  - **Cloud Controller Manager**: Integrates with cloud services to manage external resources like load balancers, storage, and network policies.

2. **Node (Worker Nodes)**:
  - **Kubelet**: An agent running on each node that ensures containers are running in a Pod.
  - **Kube Proxy**: Manages networking and load balancing for Pods across nodes.
  - **Container Runtime**: The software used to run containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

3. **Pod**:
  - The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes. A Pod contains one or more containers (such as Docker containers) that share storage and network resources.
  - Pods are ephemeral and can be **scaled**, **restarted**, or **deleted** depending on the desired state defined by the user.

4. **Cluster**:
  - A set of **worker nodes** that run your applications and services. Kubernetes clusters can scale horizontally by adding more nodes or vertically by adding more resources to existing nodes.

## **Part 4: Deploying Applications in Kubernetes â€” Configurations, Deployments, and Services**

### **Step 1: Creating a Deployment**

A **Deployment** is a Kubernetes resource that manages a set of **replicas** of your application. It ensures that the correct number of replicas are always running.

1. **Create a Deployment YAML File**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This deployment will create 3 replicas of the `myapp` container running on port `8080`.

2. **Apply the Deployment**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

3. **Verify the Deployment**:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

### **Step 2: Exposing the Deployment with a Service**

To expose your application outside the cluster, you need to create a **Service**. A service provides a stable IP and DNS name, and it can load balance traffic to multiple pods.

1. **Create a Service YAML File**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

2. **Apply the Service**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

3. **Check the Service**:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

The service will provide a stable IP or DNS that can be used to access your application from outside the cluster.

## **Part 5: Scaling and Managing Kubernetes â€” Auto-scaling, Rollouts, and Rollbacks**

### **Step 1: Auto-scaling in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes supports **horizontal pod autoscaling**, which adjusts the number of pods based on **CPU utilization** or custom metrics.

1. **Enable Auto-scaling**:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment myapp-deployment --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=5
```

This will auto-scale your application between 1 and 5 replicas based on the average CPU usage.

### **Step 2: Rollouts and Rollbacks**

Kubernetes allows you to **update applications** with zero downtime and roll back to previous versions if something goes wrong.

1. **Rolling Update**:

To update your application:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment myapp=myapp:v2
```

2. **Rollback**:

If the update causes issues, you can roll back to the previous version:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment
```

---

## **Part 6: Advanced Kubernetes â€” Security, Monitoring, and Maintenance**

### **Step 1: Securing Kubernetes**

1. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
   Kubernetes uses RBAC to control access to resources. Define **Roles** and **RoleBindings** to control who can access certain resources.

2. **Network Policies**:
   Define **network policies** to control the traffic flow between pods.

### **Step 2: Monitoring Kubernetes with Prometheus**

1. **Install Prometheus** for monitoring cluster health and resource usage.

### **Step 3: Maintenance and Updates**

1. **Kubernetes Upgrades**: Regularly update Kubernetes components using `kubeadm upgrade`.

# âš“CAP10's BONUS ðŸ’Ž


## **Cap10Billâ€™s Guide to Managing Multiple Kubernetes Configurations with Aliases**

Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters can be tedious, especially when you need to frequently switch between environments like **dev**, **stage**, **QA**, **prod**, or **AWS EKS**. Luckily, with **aliases**, you can streamline this process and save a ton of time.

### **Why Use Aliases for Kubernetes?**

Using **aliases** for Kubernetes allows you to avoid typing lengthy commands and configurations repeatedly. This not only **saves time**, but also **reduces the limited amount of keystrokes** you have left when managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.

Instead of repeatedly specifying the full `kubectl --kube-config=<path-to-config>` command every time, you can create simple aliases for each environment, making your workflow much faster and more efficient.

### **How to Create Aliases for Kubernetes**

In your shell (either **Bash** or **PowerShell**), you can define aliases to quickly switch between Kubernetes environments. Letâ€™s go over the process.

#### **1. Bash Aliases for Kubernetes**

In **Bash**, you can add these aliases to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file.

1. **Open the Bash configuration file**:

   ```bash
   vim ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Add the following aliases for each environment**:

   ```bash
   # Alias for production environment
   alias kprod='kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/prod.kubeconfig'

   # Alias for development environment
   alias kdev='kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/dev.kubeconfig'

   # Alias for staging environment
   alias kstage='kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/stage.kubeconfig'

   # Alias for QA environment
   alias kqa='kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/qa.kubeconfig'

   # Alias for AWS EKS environment
   alias kek='kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/eks.kubeconfig'
   ```

3. **Save and exit**:

   After adding these aliases, save the file and exit the editor.

4. **Apply the changes**:

   Reload the configuration by running:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### **2. PowerShell Functions for Kubernetes**

For **PowerShell** users, instead of simple aliases, you can define **functions** to switch between environments.

1. **Open your PowerShell profile**:

   ```powershell
   notepad.exe $PROFILE
   ```

2. **Add the following functions**:

   ```powershell
   function kprod {
       $env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.kube\prod.kubeconfig"
       kubectl $args
   }

   function kdev {
       $env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.kube\dev.kubeconfig"
       kubectl $args
   }

   function kstage {
       $env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.kube\stage.kubeconfig"
       kubectl $args
   }

   function kqa {
       $env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.kube\qa.kubeconfig"
       kubectl $args
   }

   function kek {
       $env:KUBECONFIG="C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\.kube\eks.kubeconfig"
       kubectl $args
   }
   ```

3. **Save and reload your profile**:

   After saving the changes, reload your PowerShell profile:

   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

---

## **How to Use These Aliases**

With these aliases (or functions in PowerShell), you can now switch between different environments with minimal keystrokes, and use the `kubectl` command just as you normally would, but with the specific context set for each environment.

Here are the steps:

1. **Switch to the Production Environment**:

   Instead of typing out the full `kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/prod.kubeconfig`, just type:

   ```bash
   kprod
   ```

   This will switch to your **production environment**.

2. **Check Pods in All Namespaces for Production**:

   ```bash
   kprod get pods -A
   ```

   This is equivalent to:

   ```bash
   kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/prod.kubeconfig get pods -A
   ```

3. **Switch to Development Environment**:

   Type:

   ```bash
   kdev
   ```

4. **Check Pods in All Namespaces for Development**:

   ```bash
   kdev get pods -A
   ```

You can quickly switch between environments and run Kubernetes commands without worrying about typing out the full `--kubeconfig` parameter each time.

---

## **Cap10Billâ€™s Takeaway**

By using **Bash aliases** or **PowerShell functions**, you can easily manage multiple Kubernetes configurations and environments. This approach not only **saves you time** but also reduces the limited keystrokes available when working across several Kubernetes clusters.

Instead of worrying about typing out full `kubectl` commands with multiple `--kubeconfig` options, you can just type a simple alias like `kprod`, `kdev`, or `kqa`, and proceed to work seamlessly.

Get your Kubernetes workflow optimized â€” make it **faster**, **cleaner**, and **less error-prone** with these simple **aliases**. Whether youâ€™re juggling multiple clusters for **dev**, **stage**, **QA**, or **production**, these aliases will make your life easier.

Now youâ€™re ready to deploy, manage, and scale your Kubernetes environments with just a few keystrokes. Go ahead and **level up** your Kubernetes game!
