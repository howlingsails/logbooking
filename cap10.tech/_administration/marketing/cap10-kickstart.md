### **Research & Competitive Analysis**

To ensure that “Cap10 Kickstart” is optimally positioned, consider the following research strategies:

- **Competitor Analysis:**  
  Research other low-cost digital offerings in the operational skills and command‑line education space (e.g., Udemy, Coursera micro-courses, niche YouTube tutorials). Identify gaps such as lack of integrated logbooking or community support.

- **Audience Insights:**  
  Use surveys, social media polls, and website analytics to gauge your audience’s current pain points and desired outcomes. This information will fine-tune module content and ensure alignment with learner needs.

- **Content Engagement Metrics:**  
  Leverage existing metrics (like your “7 hours” threshold insight) to design the product so that cumulative engagement exceeds the minimum needed for lasting familiarity. Analyze which free content pieces garner the most interaction and incorporate similar elements in the mini-course.

- **Feedback Loops:**  
  Pilot the product with a small segment of your audience, gather detailed feedback, and iterate on content delivery, pricing, and format before a full-scale launch.
