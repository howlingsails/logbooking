# Integration of ATmega168P with Pressure Sensors, Display, and Control Components

## Introduction

This report outlines how to wire together all components from the given bill of materials (BOM) onto a single PCB with an ATmega168P microcontroller as the central controller. The system includes two analog pressure sensors, a user interface (potentiometers and an 8×1 LCD display), input switches (DIP switch), and output drivers (a MOSFET for DC control and a TRIAC via an optocoupler for AC control). We also cover the power supply design using voltage regulators and protective components (diodes, MOV, etc.), and provide example code (Arduino-style C) demonstrating how to read sensors and switches, drive the display, and control the outputs. Finally, we discuss power management considerations and recommendations for high-speed and efficient code (use of interrupts, polling techniques, etc.). Key design principles such as proper decoupling, reference voltage usage, and safe isolation for AC components are emphasized.

## Circuit Design and Integration

### Power Supply and Regulation

**Supply Input and Regulation:** The system is powered by a regulated +5V supply using the **LM1117-5.0** linear regulator. Ensure the input to the LM1117 is sufficiently above 5V (e.g. 7–12V DC) to account for dropout. If the source is AC, a diode like **S1G** can be used for rectification or reverse-polarity protection (for a DC input, place S1G in series with Vin to prevent damage if polarity is reversed). A large electrolytic capacitor (e.g. **470 µF**) is placed at the regulator input (after the diode) to smooth out the rectified voltage or any supply dips. At the LM1117 output, use a **10 µF** capacitor (tantalum or electrolytic) for stability, as recommended by the regulator datasheet ([[PDF] LM1117 800-mA, Low-Dropout Linear Regulator - Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117.pdf#:~:text=A%20minimum%20of%2010,the%20transient%20response%20and%20stability)). In addition, place a **0.1 µF** ceramic capacitor **close to the LM1117’s output and input pins** to filter high-frequency noise. The **LM1117** requires at least 10 µF on its output to maintain stable operation ([[PDF] LM1117 800-mA, Low-Dropout Linear Regulator - Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117.pdf#:~:text=A%20minimum%20of%2010,the%20transient%20response%20and%20stability)), so the combination of 10 µF and 0.1 µF covers both bulk and high-frequency decoupling needs. The +5V output from the regulator powers the ATmega168P (Vcc and AVcc), the pressure sensors, potentiometers, and the LCD module. The pressure sensors specifically need a stable 5V (they operate in 4.75–5.25V range ([MPXV5100GC6U NXP USA Inc. | Sensors, Transducers | DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MPXV5100GC6U/951850#:~:text=Voltage%20))), so this regulated supply is critical for accuracy.

**ATmega168P Power Pins:** Connect both the **VCC** and **AVCC** pins of the ATmega168P to the +5V supply. Even if the ADC or analog functions aren’t used, **AVCC must be tied to VCC** for the microcontroller to function properly ([Do I need to connect AREF, AVCC and AGND - General Guidance - Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/do-i-need-to-connect-aref-avcc-and-agnd/117093#:~:text=,use%20digital%20supply%20voltage%2C%20VCC)). In this design the ADC *will* be used (for sensors and pots), so it’s good practice to isolate AVCC with a small filter. Often a **ferrite bead or 10 Ω resistor** is placed between VCC and AVCC to form an RC filter with a decoupling capacitor; in our BOM a **0 Ω resistor** can serve as a jumper to connect AVCC to 5V (or to insert a small ferrite in its place later). Place a **0.1 µF capacitor** from AVCC to the nearest ground (AGND) pin for analog supply decoupling. Likewise, place 0.1 µF decoupling capacitors near the ATmega’s VCC pins. The ATmega168P has multiple ground pins – ensure all ground pins (GND and AGND) are tied together to a common ground plane or star point. (AGND on the ATmega should connect to the digital ground – the datasheet notes that AVCC should be connected to VCC and filtered if ADC is used ([Do I need to connect AREF, AVCC and AGND - General Guidance - Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/do-i-need-to-connect-aref-avcc-and-agnd/117093#:~:text=,use%20digital%20supply%20voltage%2C%20VCC)), and AGND tied to GND.) A stable reference for ADC is needed: if using the default reference (AVCC = 5V), simply connect a **0.1 µF** capacitor from the AREF pin to ground for stability. (Leave AREF not connected to 5V directly – the microcontroller will internally connect AVCC to AREF when configured, and the capacitor filters the reference.) If higher ADC accuracy is required, the **TLV431** precision shunt regulator (programmable reference) can be used to provide an external reference voltage: for example, TLV431 could be configured to output 2.5 V or 3.0 V to the AREF pin, and the ADC can be set (in code) to use external AREF. This would improve ADC stability against VCC fluctuations, though in this design the pressure sensors are ratiometric to VCC, so using AVCC as the reference actually cancels out a lot of supply variation error by design.

**Grounding and Protection:** Use a single contiguous ground plane if possible, with careful attention to return currents. High-current and noisy loops (e.g. the TRIAC/MOSFET drivers and the LCD backlight if applicable) should have their return paths isolated from sensitive analog ground areas. The **0 Ω resistor** can be used as a jump link to separate or join ground regions if needed (e.g. sometimes analog ground is tied to digital ground at one point using a 0 Ω link to control where the connection occurs). In general, all grounds will ultimately connect together at the regulator negative output.

On the AC mains side, for safety and noise suppression, use the **MOV-20D201K varistor** across the AC line terminals (Line and Neutral). The MOV is placed **after the fuse** (a fuse is highly recommended even if not listed in BOM) and across the incoming AC lines to clamp surges – it will conduct if the voltage spikes above ~200 V (for a 130 VAC rated MOV ([BOURNS MOV-20D201K VARISTOR, 200V, 130VAC, 170VDC ...](https://www.amazon.com/BOURNS-MOV-20D201K-VARISTOR-130VAC-170VDC/dp/B00DDEZ3D4#:~:text=BOURNS%20MOV,200V%2C%20130VAC%2C%20170VDC%2C%2020MM%20DISC))) to protect the circuit from transients. Additionally, an **RC snubber network** (the **15 Ω resistor** in series with the **0.22 µF** capacitor) should be placed across the TRIAC (between MT1 and MT2 terminals) or across the load. This snubber absorbs high dV/dt transients when switching inductive or capacitive loads, preventing false triggering of the TRIAC and reducing electromagnetic interference. (Typical snubber values are on the order of 50 Ω and 0.1 µF for 230 VAC; our design uses 15 Ω and 0.22 µF to robustly handle transients – a slightly stronger snub for potentially noisy loads.) The combination of the MOV and RC snubber will protect the TRIAC and other components from voltage spikes ([Triac optocoupler circuit - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/381961/triac-optocoupler-circuit#:~:text=Ans%3A%20Rs%20%3D%2033%20Ohms%2C,%28Accroding%20to%20R%3DV%2FI)). Keep these high-voltage components well separated from low-voltage circuitry on the PCB to maintain safety isolation.

Finally, note the thermal considerations: The LM1117 regulator may dissipate heat depending on input voltage and load current. For example, with a 12 V input and ~50 mA load, the regulator drops 7 V and will dissipate ~0.35 W. Provide copper area as a heat sink or a small heat sink if the current draw is significant (if driving many devices or a bright LCD backlight, etc.). The **MAC223A8** TRIAC can switch up to 8 A AC, which will generate heat when conducting; it must be mounted to a heatsink or a heatsinking area of copper if switching high currents continuously. Ensure any heatsinks or exposed metal for the TRIAC are properly insulated as needed because they may be at mains potential. The pressure sensors and other components are low-power and don’t need special cooling, but keep the pressure sensors away from heat sources on the board since they are calibrated and temperature compensated devices.

### Microcontroller and Core Connections

The **ATmega168P** is the brains of the circuit. It should be wired in a minimal “Arduino-like” configuration for reliable operation:

- **Power Pins:** Connect VCC and AVCC to +5V as described, with decoupling caps. Connect all GND pins to ground. (AVCC through the 0 Ω link or small filter to VCC.) AREF to a 0.1 µF cap to ground (and to TLV431’s output if using an external reference).

- **Reset:** The ATmega168P reset pin (PC6) is pulled up to +5V through a **10 kΩ resistor**. This ensures the chip runs normally by default. You can add a reset button from RESET to ground (momentarily pulling it low to reset the MCU). If using an Arduino bootloader, a 0.1 µF capacitor from the DTR signal of a USB-serial adapter to RESET would be used to auto-reset for programming, but if programming via ISP, this isn’t required. In any case, the 10 kΩ resistor on RESET is necessary for stable operation.

- **Clock:** The BOM does not list a crystal, so the ATmega168P can use its internal 8 MHz oscillator (or 1 MHz by default fuse). For many applications 8 MHz internal RC is sufficient. If more accuracy or speed (16 MHz) is needed, add a 16 MHz crystal or resonator and the proper load capacitors (22 pF) between the XTAL1/XTAL2 pins and ground. Ensure fuse settings are configured appropriately if using a custom clock. For our purposes, assume the internal oscillator is fine (keeping timing error in mind if using serial communication – adjust baud or use a calibrated oscillator if needed).

- **I/O Pins and Peripherals:** We will detail specific connections for sensors, switches, display, and outputs in the following subsections. **Table 1** below summarizes the microcontroller pin assignments and connections to the various components in this design.

### Pressure Sensors (MPXV5100GC6U/GC7U) – Analog Inputs

The design includes two Freescale/NXP **MPXV5100** series pressure sensors (likely the GC6U and GC7U variants, which are 0–100 kPa gauge pressure transducers with different port orientations). Each sensor is an analog device that outputs a voltage proportional to the sensed pressure. According to the datasheet, the output spans approximately **0.2 V at 0 kPa up to 4.7 V at 100 kPa** (when powered from 5 V) ([MPXV5100GC6U NXP USA Inc. | Sensors, Transducers | DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MPXV5100GC6U/951850#:~:text=14)). This output will be read by the ATmega168P’s analog-to-digital converter (ADC).

**Wiring:** Connect each sensor’s Vcc pin to +5V and its GND pin to the common ground. It’s good practice to place a decoupling capacitor (e.g. 0.1 µF) close to the sensor between its Vcc and GND pins to reduce noise. The output pin of each sensor goes to an ADC input on the ATmega. For example, connect the first sensor’s output to **ADC0 (PC0)** and the second sensor’s output to **ADC1 (PC1)**. No additional signal conditioning is required since the output is already analog DC in the 0–5 V range. **Do not exceed 5 V** on these inputs – in normal operation 4.7 V is max ([MPXV5100GC6U NXP USA Inc. | Sensors, Transducers | DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MPXV5100GC6U/951850#:~:text=14)), which is within range. The ATmega’s internal ADC has 10-bit resolution, which will digitize 0–5 V into values 0–1023. With the sensor’s range, 0 kPa (~0.2 V) will read around 40 counts and 100 kPa (~4.7 V) around 960 counts (we will handle this offset in software).

If the sensor cables are long or the environment is noisy, you can add a small capacitor (e.g. 1 nF to 0.1 µF) from the sensor output to ground to act as a low-pass filter and stabilize the ADC readings. However, this will slow the sensor response slightly. Typically, the MPXV5100 series is stable and has internal filtering, so this may not be needed.

**ADC Reference:** We will use AVcc (5 V) as the ADC reference so that the full 0–5 V range is measured. This is convenient because the sensor’s output is ratiometric to its supply – any minor variations in the 5 V supply will equally affect the sensor output and the ADC reference, canceling out and improving measurement accuracy. If using the TLV431 for an external reference (e.g. a fixed 4.5 V or 3.0 V reference), ensure the sensor output does not exceed that reference. In our case, sticking with the 5 V AVcc reference is simplest.

**Additional Note:** The two sensors can measure pressure independently. If a differential measurement is needed, that would typically require a different sensor variant; here both are gauge sensors (vented to atmosphere on one side). The microcontroller can read both and perhaps use one as a backup or for dual-range sensing if the sensors are configured differently (the GC6U vs GC7U might just indicate package type). In the code, we’ll read ADC0 and ADC1 to get the sensor voltages, and then convert those to pressure values (kPa) using the known linear transfer function of the sensor.

### Potentiometers – User Input and LCD Contrast

There are two potentiometers in the BOM: a **Bourns TC33X-2-103E** and an **Alps RK09L1140A2U**, both likely 10 kΩ (“103” indicates 10×10^3 Ω). These serve different purposes:

- **LCD Contrast Pot (TC33X-2-103E):** Typically, character LCD modules require a contrast voltage on the **VO (contrast)** pin, usually around 0.4 V to 1 V for optimal text visibility (for a 5 V module). We use the small trimmer pot (Bourns TC33X) as a variable voltage divider to generate this contrast voltage. Connect one end of the pot to 5 V, the other end to GND, and the wiper (middle pin) to the LCD module’s **VO** pin. Adjusting this pot will change the LCD’s contrast. This potentiometer is **not** read by the microcontroller; it’s an analog control for the display. You can mount it on the PCB and adjust it with a screwdriver until the characters on the LCD are clearly visible (not too faint, not all black boxes). Once set, it’s generally not changed during operation.

- **User Input Pot (Alps RK09L1140A2U):** The second pot is likely a panel-mounted knob for user interaction (for example, setting a target pressure, speed, or some parameter). This pot is connected as a **voltage divider** to an ADC input on the ATmega. For instance, connect one end of the pot to +5V, the other end to GND, and the wiper to **ADC2 (PC2)**. This will provide an analog voltage from 0 V (when turned one way) to 5 V (the other way), which the microcontroller can read. The microcontroller will interpret this, for example, as a set-point or control value. In our code, we might use this pot reading to modulate the output (like adjusting the duty cycle of the MOSFET output or some threshold for the triac activation). Because the pot is 10 kΩ, the source impedance is moderate; the ATmega’s ADC input impedance is very high, but for best ADC accuracy it’s recommended the source impedance be <10 kΩ. In practice 10 kΩ works fine, but if we needed faster ADC sampling, we could put a buffer or lower the impedance. Here it’s acceptable. If the pot’s reading is noisy or jittery, one can add a small capacitor (e.g. 0.01–0.1 µF) from the wiper to ground to stabilize it, but this also slows response to quick knob changes (not usually an issue for a user knob).

### DIP Switch Inputs (Configuration Switches)

The design includes a DIP switch (Dual Inline Package switch) for configuration or mode selection. A DIP switch is essentially a set of toggle switches. A common DIP might have 4 or 8 individual switches in one package. We’ll assume an **8-position DIP switch** (since DIP switches commonly come in 4, 6, 8 positions and the BOM didn’t specify count – we’ll design for up to 8 inputs, which can be reduced if not all are needed). Each DIP switch connects an input either to ground or leaves it floating/high depending on position, so proper pull-up/pull-down resistors must be used to ensure a defined logic level at all times.

**Wiring:** The simplest way to wire a DIP switch to a microcontroller is to connect one side of each switch to ground (common ground bus for the DIP switches), and the other side to a microcontroller digital input pin. Then use a **pull-up resistor** to +5V on each input so that when the switch is open (OFF), the input is pulled high (logic 1), and when the switch is closed (ON), it connects the input directly to ground (logic 0). This configuration is active-low (switch ON gives 0). We can use the ATmega168P’s **internal pull-up resistors** instead of external resistors to simplify wiring. In the BOM, several **10 kΩ resistors** are available, which could be used as external pull-ups if needed, but it’s usually not necessary since the MCU can enable internal pull-ups ~20–50 kΩ. If using internal pull-ups, simply connect each switch between the MCU pin and ground. If using external resistors, connect one side of each switch to ground, the other side to the MCU pin *and* a 10 kΩ resistor from that node to +5V.

The DIP switch likely has a common pin or can be arranged such that one side of all switches is common – ensure that common side is tied to ground (if using pull-ups). **Do not leave inputs floating** when switches are open, as that can cause unpredictable behavior ([microcontroller - DIP switches and IC inputs - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/600613/dip-switches-and-ic-inputs#:~:text=You%20should%20never%20leave%20the,low%2C%20you%20never%20know%20which)). By using pull-ups, *“the input reads high when the switch is not actuated, and low when it is, grounding the pull-up resistor.”* ([microcontroller - DIP switches and IC inputs - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/600613/dip-switches-and-ic-inputs#:~:text=But%20it%20is%20very%20common,up%20resistor)) This is the standard practice for switch inputs.

Assign each DIP switch to a microcontroller digital pin. For example, use ATmega pins PD2–PD5 (Arduino digital 2–5) for DIP switch bits 1–4, and PB0–PB3 (if available) or PC4–PC5 for additional bits if using more switches. In our proposed pin mapping, we use 4 switches on Port D for simplicity. If an 8-switch DIP is used, we could use Port B or a mix of ports for the other four. Just ensure to configure each corresponding pin as an input with pull-up in firmware. **Table 1** shows an example mapping for 4 DIP switches to PD2–PD5.

**Usage:** DIP switches are typically read at startup or occasionally in the program loop to adjust configuration. They might select modes (e.g. one switch could select which pressure sensor is active, another might enable/disable the triac control, etc.). In our code example, we’ll demonstrate using these switches to toggle certain behaviors (like which sensor’s data is shown, or turning the outputs on/off manually). DIP switches are not meant for high-frequency toggling (they are physical toggles set by the user), so reading them via polling in the main loop is sufficient (no need for interrupts). If using an 8-bit DIP and wiring all switches to one port (e.g. Port D0–D7, though D0/D1 are UART pins so maybe Port B or C), you can read the whole port at once to get an 8-bit value representing the switch pattern. In our case, we treat them individually for clarity. Also note that mechanical switches can **bounce** (briefly flicker between on/off as they change state). For DIP switches, bounce isn’t usually a big problem because they are not flipped rapidly or read on the fly; a small delay or a second read can confirm the state if needed. If you plan to adjust DIP switches during operation (not just at startup), you might implement a simple debounce (check that the reading is stable over a few milliseconds).

### 8×1 Character LCD Display (AMC0801A)

The display module, **AMC0801A**, is an 8 characters by 1 line LCD. It is likely compatible with the common **HD44780** controller (many character LCDs are), which means it uses a parallel interface with either 8-bit or 4-bit data mode plus a couple of control lines. We will assume it uses the standard 14-pin (or 16-pin including backlight) interface:

- Vss (GND)
- Vdd (+5V)
- VO (contrast voltage input)
- RS (Register Select)
- R/W (Read/Write select)
- E (Enable)
- D0–D7 (8 data lines)
- (Optional: A and K for LED backlight anode and cathode, if a backlight is present)

For simplicity, we will use the LCD in **4-bit mode** (which uses only D4–D7 data lines) because that saves microcontroller pins and is standard for Arduino libraries. In 4-bit mode, data is sent to the LCD in two nibbles for each byte.

**Wiring:**

- **Power and Contrast:** Connect Vss to GND and Vdd to +5V. The contrast pin VO goes to the wiper of the contrast potentiometer as described earlier. No direct MCU connection for VO. If the module has a backlight, connect the backlight LED+ (often labeled A or LED+) to +5V through an appropriate resistor, and LED- (K) to ground. In our BOM, a **15 Ω resistor** is available, which could be used for the backlight LED if needed. (The correct resistor value depends on the LED’s forward voltage and desired current. For example, if the backlight is a white LED (~3.0 V drop) and we want ~20 mA: (5 V–3 V)/20 mA ≈ 100 Ω. A 15 Ω resistor would allow a much higher current (over 100 mA) which is likely too high, so either the display has an internal resistor or the 15 Ω is intended for something like an infrared LED. It’s more likely the display is a monochrome with an LED that has an internal resistor or requires a different value. Double-check the AMC0801A datasheet for backlight requirements. If unsure, start with a higher resistor like 150 Ω to avoid over-driving the backlight). In summary, ensure the backlight is wired correctly: many small LCDs have an internal resistor and specify 5V directly on A/K, but others need an external resistor (the BOM suggests one is provided).

- **Control Lines (RS, E, R/W):** Connect **RS (Register Select)** to a digital I/O pin on the ATmega (this pin controls whether LCD data is interpreted as command or character data). In our pin map, we use **PB0** for RS. Connect **E (Enable)** to another digital pin (we use **PB1**). **R/W** can be tied to GND if we only intend to write to the LCD (which is most common – we seldom read from the LCD). By grounding R/W, we put the module in write-only mode, and we save a microcontroller pin. This means we won’t check the busy flag; instead, we’ll use proper delays in software to allow commands to execute. If one wanted to use R/W to read the busy flag or read back DDRAM, they could wire R/W to a pin, but it isn’t necessary.

- **Data Lines:** In 4-bit mode, only **D4, D5, D6, D7** of the LCD are used. Connect these to four digital outputs on the microcontroller. We use **PB2, PB3, PB4, PB5** respectively (which correspond to Arduino digital pins 10, 11, 12, 13). This grouping on Port B allows for potentially faster writes (since they are contiguous bits on one port), but it’s also fine wiring-wise on a PCB to keep them together. **D0–D3** of the LCD should be left unconnected (they’ll be unused in 4-bit mode, but must be present on the module; typically you tie D0–D3 to ground if not used. However, many Arduino tutorials leave them floating since the LCD internally ignores them in 4-bit mode after initialization. To be safe from noise, you can tie D0–D3 to GND through a resistor network or directly, but it’s optional).

**Note:** Ensure the LCD’s ground (Vss) is common with the microcontroller ground, and the +5V for Vdd is from the regulated supply. The contrast pot ground should also tie to the same ground.

**Initialization and Use:** After wiring, the LCD will require initialization in software (sending specific command bytes to set 4-bit mode, display on, etc.). In our code section, we’ll either use the Arduino `LiquidCrystal` library (which abstracts this) or demonstrate the sequence. The key things to remember in circuit design are to route those control and data lines properly and to include the contrast adjustment. Also, the LCD can draw a noticeable current if it has a backlight (could be 10–30 mA), which the 5V regulator must supply. If power consumption is a concern, you can put the backlight under the control of the microcontroller (through a transistor like the MOSFET or another transistor) to turn it off to save power, but typically a small backlight can be on all the time. (Our MOSFET is likely reserved for another purpose, so if backlight control was needed, a simple NPN transistor or an unused MOSFET could be used.)

Mount the LCD either via a header or directly on the PCB such that the pins match the wiring. Make sure to label the pins on the PCB for Vcc, GND, etc., to avoid mis-connection. The 8×1 display will show up to 8 characters, so your software will have to be mindful of the limited width (for example, if showing a long message, you might scroll it or truncate it).

### MOSFET Output (2N7002) – Low-Side Switch for DC Load

The **2N7002** is an N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET (a small signal MOSFET) used to switch or control DC loads. It’s typically used as a low-side switch, meaning it connects/disconnects the load to ground. In our design, this MOSFET can be used to drive a **DC load** such as a small motor, a solenoid valve, an LED indicator, or perhaps the LCD backlight or an audio buzzer – essentially anything within its current and voltage limits. The 2N7002 is a SOT-23 transistor that can handle around 200 mA and up to 60 V, but for reliability, keep the continuous current well below that (around 100 mA or so). It has a low gate threshold (logic-level gate), so it can be driven directly by the ATmega’s 5V logic.

**Wiring:** Connect the **2N7002’s source to ground** (0V). The **drain** goes to the negative side of the load you want to control. The **load’s positive side** should be connected to a +V supply. If the load can run on 5V, use the +5V supply. If it requires a higher voltage (say 12V for a small fan or solenoid), you’ll need a separate supply for that, and be sure to tie the ground of that supply to the common ground so that the MOSFET has a reference. The **gate** of the MOSFET connects to a digital output pin on the ATmega (through a small resistor if desired, e.g. 100 Ω, to limit gate ringing – but in most cases for low frequency switching, it can be tied directly). We use **PD6** (Arduino digital 6) to drive the MOSFET gate, as listed in Table 1. PD6 is also a hardware PWM output (OC0A), which means we can use `analogWrite(6, value)` to modulate the MOSFET with PWM if we want to control a variable speed or brightness.

**Flyback Diode (for inductive loads):** If the load is inductive (motor, relay coil, solenoid, etc.), you **must** connect a diode across the load to catch high voltage spikes when the MOSFET turns off (this is a flyback or freewheel diode). The BOM includes some diodes that could serve this purpose: for example, a **BAT54A** (Schottky diode) or a **BAV70** (small signal diode) can be used for moderate current inductive loads. Connect the diode **cathode to the +V side of the load, anode to the MOSFET drain (load’s ground side)**. This way, when the MOSFET turns off and the inductance tries to keep current flowing, the diode conducts and recirculates the current, clamping the voltage spike to about 0.3 V (if using BAT54 Schottky) or 0.7 V (for BAV70) above the supply. This protects the MOSFET from overvoltage. For example, if the MOSFET is driving a small 12 V relay coil (~30 mA), a BAT54 or BAV70 would be suitable since they handle up to ~200 mA continuous and have surge capability for the brief spike. If the inductive load were larger (like a motor several hundred mA), a beefier diode (1N5819 Schottky or 1N400x series) would be needed. In our BOM we don’t have a 1N400x, so likely the intention is small loads or the diode network can parallel if needed.

If the load is purely resistive (like an LED strip or something non-inductive), a flyback diode is not needed. But it never hurts to include pads for one in case the use-case changes.

**Usage:** In the microcontroller code, set PD6 as an output. Driving PD6 HIGH will apply 5V to the MOSFET gate. The 2N7002, being an N-channel, will fully enhance at Vgs ~4.5–5V, so it will conduct strongly and connect the drain to ground (low Rds_on, a few ohms or less), turning **ON** the load. Setting PD6 LOW makes Vgs=0, turning the MOSFET **OFF**, so the load is disconnected from ground (no current flows). We can either do digital on/off control or PWM for intermediate values. For example, if the load is a small pump or fan and we want to control speed, we could output a PWM signal on PD6 (Timer0 can do fast PWM on OC0A which is PD6). The code might use `analogWrite(6, duty)` where duty is 0–255. The PWM frequency on Timer0 is about 976 Hz by default on Arduino – fine for most motors or LEDs.

The **2N7002** is a small transistor, so double-check the load requirements. If the load is near the MOSFET’s limits, you might need a larger MOSFET (in a SOT-223 or DPAK package, etc.). For instance, an 8 Ω 5V coil draws 0.625 A, which would likely overheat a 2N7002. But something like a 50 Ω 12V relay coil (0.24 A) is borderline – short pulses might be okay, but continuous might overheat it. In our scenario, it’s probably meant for a small indicator or part of the circuit (maybe driving the optocoupler LED could have been done with the MOSFET, but that’s unnecessary since the MCU can directly drive it). We’ll assume it’s for a small output like a buzzer or secondary actuator.

### TRIAC Output (MAC223A8) with Optocoupler (MOC3023) – AC Mains Control

For controlling an AC mains load (such as a heater, motor, lamp, etc.), the design uses a combination of a TRIAC and an optoisolator:
- The **MAC223A8** is a TRIAC (rated for 600 V, 8 A, I_T(RMS)), used to switch AC current.
- The **MOC3023** is an opto-isolated TRIAC driver (optocoupler with a triac output). It provides electrical isolation between the low-voltage control (microcontroller side) and the high-voltage AC side. The MOC3023 is a **random-phase optocoupler** (not zero-cross), meaning it will trigger the TRIAC as soon as its LED is driven, regardless of AC phase (useful for phase-angle control if needed).

**Wiring – Optocoupler LED side (Low Voltage):** The LED inside the MOC3023 is connected between a microcontroller output pin and ground, through a resistor. We use **PD7** (Arduino digital 7) to drive the opto’s LED anode. Connect PD7 to the **anode of the MOC3023 LED**. Connect the **cathode of the MOC3023 LED** to ground. Place a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED (between PD7 and the anode). The resistor value is chosen to limit LED current to the required trigger current. The MOC3023 typically triggers at I_F ≈ 15 mA or less. With a 5 V drive from the MCU and about ~1.2 V drop across the LED, we have ~3.8 V across the resistor. A **360 Ω resistor** gives about 10.5 mA (3.8/360) which should reliably trigger the optocoupler while being safe for the MCU pin. The BOM indeed has a 360 Ω resistor, which matches typical recommendations (in fact, one source suggests 360 Ω for 5 mA trigger MOC devices to avoid LED overcurrent surges at 220 VAC ([Triac optocoupler circuit - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/381961/triac-optocoupler-circuit#:~:text=Ans%3A%20Rs%20%3D%2033%20Ohms%2C,%28Accroding%20to%20R%3DV%2FI))). Using 360 Ω instead of a lower value ensures the MOC3023’s LED is not overdriven – it protects against surge currents and prolongs the opto’s life ([Triac optocoupler circuit - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/381961/triac-optocoupler-circuit#:~:text=Ans%3A%20Rs%20%3D%2033%20Ohms%2C,%28Accroding%20to%20R%3DV%2FI)). So connect the **360 Ω resistor in series with PD7 and the MOC3023 anode**.

No other connections are needed on the input side; the MOC3023 LED cathode goes to the common ground with the microcontroller. When PD7 goes HIGH, current flows through the LED, activating the optocoupler; when PD7 is LOW, the LED is off.

**Wiring – TRIAC side (High Voltage AC):** The MOC3023’s output is a small triac that, when the LED is on, connects its two output terminals with a very small current (this in turn triggers the main TRIAC). Connect the **MOC3023 output pins** as follows: one output pin to the **gate of the MAC223A8 TRIAC**, the other output pin to the **MT2 terminal of the TRIAC** (or to the hot AC line that goes to MT2). In many TRIAC driver circuits, MT2 (one of the main terminals of the TRIAC, often the one connected to the AC line or load) is used as the return path for the opto-triac. The MAC223A8 has two main terminals (let’s call them MT1 and MT2) and a Gate. Typically:
- Connect **MT2** of the triac to the AC **Line** (or to the load, depending on whether you’re switching live or neutral; usually we put the triac in series with the live line for safety).
- Connect **MT1** of the triac to the **load**, and the other side of the load goes to AC Neutral. (Or MT1 to neutral and load to MT2 line, either configuration works; what matters is gate referencing.)
- Now, connect one lead of the MOC3023 output to the **Triac Gate** pin.
- Connect the other lead of the MOC3023 output to the **Triac MT2** (since MT2 is tied to line in this example, effectively the opto output is between gate and line). Include a **gate resistor** in this path: the BOM’s **1 kΩ resistor** can be used either in series with the gate or from gate to MT1 as a pull-down. The typical approach is to put a resistor in series with the optocoupler output to limit gate current. We can use the 1 kΩ in series between the MOC3023 output and the gate of the triac. That means: MOC3023 pin -> 1 kΩ resistor -> Triac Gate. The other MOC3023 pin goes to Triac MT2 (line). This resistor will limit the gate current to a safe value (the MOC3023 can handle peaks of up to 1 A for a few microseconds ([Triac optocoupler circuit - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/381961/triac-optocoupler-circuit#:~:text=Ans%3A%20Rs%20%3D%2033%20Ohms%2C,%28Accroding%20to%20R%3DV%2FI)), but we design for much less in steady state – the resistor ensures the gate only gets the needed current, e.g. if line is 170 V peak (120 VAC), R=1k would limit to ~170 mA peak minus triac drops, but realistically the opto-triac output also has some impedance). Some designs use ~180 Ω to 360 Ω here for 120 VAC systems; our BOM chose 1 kΩ, which is a conservative value limiting gate current further. The MAC223A8 triac likely has a gate trigger current of a few milliamps (since it’s a power triac, maybe I_GT ~ 25 mA worst-case). The MOC3023 output can pass up to ~50 mA when conducting (and more in surge), so even with 1 kΩ, if 120 VAC is across MT2-MT1, once the main triac is off, the opto could drive ~ (170 V / 1k) = 170 mA into the gate for a brief moment until the triac latches, which is a lot, but in practice the triac will trigger long before such a high current flows (the gate needs maybe <20 mA to trigger at mains voltage). The 1 kΩ also helps prevent any false triggering due to leakage currents by bleeding them off. (In summary: connect 1 kΩ from Triac Gate to MOC output, and MOC output to Triac MT2.)

Additionally, you might place a **bleeder resistor** (often ~100 kΩ) from the Triac gate to MT1 to ensure the gate is referenced to MT1 when off (this prevents gate from floating if any leakage through the optocoupler). Our BOM doesn’t explicitly list a 100 kΩ, so we might rely on the 1 kΩ in series plus inherent leakage being low enough. Alternatively, the 1 kΩ could be used from gate to MT1 as a pull-down, and a smaller resistor (e.g. 330 Ω) as series gate resistor; but since we only have 1 kΩ and 360 Ω listed, one approach is: 360 Ω in series with the opto LED (we did that), and 1 kΩ from Gate to MT2 or Gate to MT1. However, putting 1 kΩ from Gate to MT2 (which is effectively between gate and line) when the opto fires might not limit current much (if opto short circuits gate to MT2 and 1k is in parallel? Better keep series). So likely 1 kΩ is meant in series as described, and no separate pull-down is used (the triac’s gate is low leakage, so it should be fine).

**AC Load and Mains:** Connect the load (whatever AC device you are controlling) in series with the triac. For example, AC Line -> Triac MT2 -> Triac MT1 -> Load -> AC Neutral. When the triac is triggered, it conducts and current flows through the load. When it’s off, the series path is open. The triac will latch on until current drops below a holding current (which happens every AC zero-cross or if you stop driving it and it passes a zero point). The optocoupler provides isolation: the microcontroller and its ground are *not connected* to the AC line at all, only through the opto’s light. This keeps the dangerous high voltage away from the microcontroller and sensors. **Important:** Maintain at least a few millimeters of clearance on the PCB between the optocoupler’s AC pins (output side) and the low-voltage pins. Similarly, keep the triac and MOV area isolated and preferably on one side of the board with sufficient creepage distance to low voltage side. Mark the AC side clearly if making a custom PCB.

**Snubber and MOV:** As described in the Power section, connect the **0.22 µF capacitor in series with the 15 Ω resistor** across the triac’s MT1 and MT2 terminals. Also connect the **MOV** across the AC supply (line to neutral). These components should be rated appropriately (the 0.22 µF must be an X2 safety capacitor for across-line use, and the resistor a proper power resistor that can handle surges; MOV should be rated 130 VAC if using on 120 VAC mains). They will suppress transients and prevent false triggers.

**Usage in Code:** To trigger the AC load, the microcontroller sets PD7 HIGH, which lights the MOC3023 LED. This, after a short propagation, connects the opto-triac output, which triggers the main triac’s gate. The main triac then conducts current until the AC current goes to zero (next zero-cross). If we want to turn the load off, we stop driving the opto LED; the triac will then turn off at the end of the AC half-cycle (since without gate current it won’t re-trigger in the next half-cycle). For simple on/off control (like a thermostat or an on/off pump control), you can just turn PD7 HIGH to turn on (and leave it HIGH continuously, the opto will keep firing every half-cycle near the zero-cross automatically because as soon as the triac turns off at zero, the opto is still lit and immediately re-triggers it – essentially continuous HIGH means the triac is on for every AC cycle). To turn off, set PD7 LOW and the triac will stop conducting at the next zero crossing of current (which for AC is at most 10 ms away on 50 Hz or 8.33 ms on 60 Hz). This is fine for many applications.

If **phase angle control** or dimming is required (for example, controlling motor speed or lamp brightness by chopping the AC waveform), the microcontroller needs to synchronize with the AC waveform. Typically this is done by detecting the AC zero-cross (using another optocoupler or a resistor divider to an input). Our BOM did not include a dedicated zero-cross detector; one could conceivably use the MOC3023 itself in a clever way to detect zero cross by monitoring when the triac turns off, but that’s complicated and not reliable as a detector. A more straightforward approach is to use a known mains frequency and a timer: for 60 Hz, one half-cycle is ~8.33 ms. One could configure a timer interrupt to trigger every 8.33 ms (120 Hz) and use that as a proxy for zero-cross (assuming the mains frequency is stable and in phase with our reference – which might not be guaranteed without actual sensing). It’s safer to include a zero-cross detection circuit (like an optocoupler H11AA1 or a simple resistor + diodes to an input) if precise phase control is needed. Given none is listed, we will assume the triac is mainly used in full-cycle on/off control (like a relay replacement). We will still mention timing considerations in the code design section for high-speed control.

**Isolation and Safety:** Reminder that the TRIAC and anything connected to it (including the optocoupler’s output side, the MOV, snubber, load, etc.) are at lethal mains voltage. Ensure that side is properly insulated. The optocoupler provides the safety barrier – never directly connect the microcontroller or sensor grounds to the AC side. When testing, use caution and preferably an isolation transformer. Also, the MAC223A8 has a metal back (if TO-220 package style) which might be connected to MT2; if mounting to a chassis or heatsink, use insulating pads if needed to avoid shorting to ground or other metal.

## Example Code (C/Arduino) for System Integration

Below is an example Arduino-style C++ code that initializes and uses the various components: it reads the two pressure sensors and user potentiometer via analog inputs, reads the DIP switch states via digital inputs, controls the LCD to display a reading, and drives the MOSFET and TRIAC outputs based on certain conditions. This code is meant for an ATmega168P (it would also run on an Arduino board with minimal changes). We use the Arduino framework for simplicity, including the `LiquidCrystal` library to drive the LCD in 4-bit mode.

  delay(200);  // 200 ms update interval (5 times per second).
}
```

**Explanation of Code:**

- We define pins according to our hardware setup. The `LiquidCrystal lcd(...)` is configured with the pins we wired for RS, E, D4-D7. We assume R/W is hard-wired to ground, and the contrast is set by hardware pot.
- In `setup()`, we initialize serial (optional for debugging), and the LCD (8x1). We print a short message to verify it’s working. We set the DIP pins as `INPUT_PULLUP` which activates internal pull-up resistors so that an open switch reads HIGH. The outputs (MOSFET, TRIAC) are set as OUTPUT and initialized to off (LOW).
- In `loop()`, we read each DIP switch with `digitalRead`. Because of pull-ups, if the switch is ON (closed to ground), the read returns LOW. We store boolean flags `dip1_on` etc. for clarity.
- We read the analog inputs using `analogRead`. This gives values 0–1023 corresponding to 0–5 V. We store raw values for pressure sensors and pot.
- We then convert the raw pressure readings to a rough pressure in kPa. We use the linear mapping: count 41 ≈ 0 kPa, count 962 ≈ 100 kPa, as derived earlier. This is just for demonstration; in a real scenario, we might calibrate those exact values or use a formula from voltage. We clamp the results between 0 and 100. (We used a float calculation for clarity. Alternatively, one could avoid float by using integer math, but that’s beyond scope here.)
- Next, we use DIP switches to control behavior:
  - **DIP1**: Manual control of the AC output. If DIP1 is ON, we set `triacPin` HIGH, which lights the optocoupler LED continuously, thus the triac is triggered every half-cycle (effectively ON). If DIP1 is OFF, we turn `triacPin` LOW, so the opto is off and the triac will stop conducting at the next AC zero cross (turning the AC load off). In effect, DIP1 acts as a on/off switch for the AC load (like a remote-controlled light switch).
  - **DIP2**: Select which pressure sensor’s data to display on the LCD. If DIP2 is OFF, we display sensor 1; if ON, display sensor 2. This is just to illustrate reading both sensors and using a DIP for configuration. In a real device, DIP2 might select different operational modes (for example, which sensor is active in control, or which units to display, etc.).
  - **DIP3**: Enable/disable the MOSFET PWM output. If DIP3 is ON, we take the potentiometer reading and output a PWM on `mosfetPin` with duty proportional to the pot. If DIP3 is OFF, we force the MOSFET off. This means the user can flip DIP3 to engage or disengage the DC motor/fan/LED control. For instance, DIP3 OFF could mean the motor is always off regardless of knob (like a safety lock), and DIP3 ON means the knob controls the motor speed. We scale the 10-bit pot value to 8-bit (0–255) by simple division by 4 (this is an approximation; more proper scaling would be `pwm = map(rawPot, 0,1023, 0,255)`, but division is fine here).
  - **DIP4**: In code we didn’t explicitly use DIP4. It could be reserved for future or other purposes (for example, toggling between pressure control modes, or enabling an alarm). In our code it’s just read but not acted on. If needed, one could incorporate it easily (e.g., if DIP4 is ON, maybe sound a buzzer via the MOSFET output or something).

- We then update the **LCD display**. We clear the display and print either “P1:XXkPa” or “P2:YYkPa” depending on DIP2. We chose to display the pressure as an integer kPa for simplicity (e.g., 37kPa). This fits in 8 characters as long as it’s up to 3 digits (“P1:100kPa” is exactly 8). If we had to show a larger number or include a decimal, we’d need to format carefully or scroll, but pressure in this range fits. We also note in comments that if the number has fewer digits, there might be a leftover character on the LCD from a previous update (since we don’t format the width), but for clarity we keep it simple. One could pad with spaces to always fill 8 chars.

- Finally, we do a `delay(200)` to wait 200 ms before the next loop iteration. This slows the loop to 5 Hz. This is to avoid flooding the LCD with commands (which can cause flicker) and to debounce the DIP reading a bit. In a more advanced approach, we might avoid using `delay` (to keep the loop responsive) and use a non-blocking timing (like checking `millis()`), but for demonstration, this is straightforward. The 200 ms delay also limits how quickly we toggle the triacPin and mosfetPin, which is fine for our manual control scenario. If we were doing phase control on the triac, we would *not* use `delay` like this, but rather time things precisely with interrupts – more on that in the next section.

- Throughout the code, we also print to the serial port if needed for debugging (e.g., we could `Serial.print` the readings to verify values in a debug session).

This code integrates all parts: reading inputs, controlling outputs, and updating a display. It is a basic round-robin loop (no concurrency or RTOS). Each iteration reads sensors and inputs, then updates outputs. In a real application, one might add logic to, say, automatically control the triac based on pressure (for example, if pressure falls below a setpoint (the pot value), trigger the triac to turn on a compressor until pressure is reached). The provided code does not implement such a closed-loop control, but it sets the stage for it (one could replace DIP1 manual control with an automatic control using sensor readings). The DIP switches allow toggling manual override or sensor selection, etc.

Also note that heavy computations (like float math) and LCD updates are happening in the loop. For an 8-bit AVR at 8 MHz, this is manageable at 5 Hz loop rate. If we needed faster response, we might avoid floating point (use integer math for pressure to speed up) and limit how often we clear the LCD (as `lcd.clear()` can be slow). We might also handle sensor reading and LCD update at different rates (e.g., read sensors more often, update LCD less often). These considerations segue into the next section on performance and efficiency.

*Table 2: Summary of how each component is interfaced and controlled in the system. Most sensing and input functions are **polled** periodically in the main loop, whereas outputs are set based on logic (with one using PWM hardware). In a more advanced design, **interrupts** might be used for timing-critical tasks (e.g., zero-cross detection for TRIAC or periodic sensor sampling), as discussed below.*

## Power Management Considerations

Designing the power supply for this integrated system requires careful attention to stable voltages, noise filtering, and component ratings:

- **Regulator Input Source:** The ATmega168P and sensors require a regulated 5V. We achieve this with the **LM1117-5.0** LDO. If the system is powered from AC mains, a step-down method is needed (not in BOM except a diode). Likely a small AC transformer or a DC wall adapter will be used to provide a lower-voltage DC input (e.g. 9–12 V DC). If using an AC transformerless supply, extreme caution – but since we have a triac controlling mains, it’s safer to assume a low-voltage transformer or adapter is feeding the LM1117. Place the **S1G diode** either as part of a full bridge rectifier or as a half-wave rectifier on an AC source. For example, a 9 VAC transformer with a single S1G diode and the 470 µF capacitor will produce about 9*1.414 - 1.1 ≈ 11.6 V DC (peak minus diode drop) with heavy ripple at 60 Hz which 470 µF will smooth. A full-wave bridge would need four diodes (only one S1G is listed, so likely half-wave or a pre-rectified source).

- **Bulk Capacitors:** The **470 µF capacitor** should be placed at the input of the LM1117 (after the diode) to provide a reservoir of energy and reduce ripple. This is especially important if the input is half-wave rectified AC, as current is only supplied on peaks. Ensure this capacitor’s voltage rating exceeds the peak DC input (for a 9–12 VAC source, peaks ~16 V, use a 25 V rated cap, 35 V for extra margin). The **10 µF capacitor** is placed at the output of LM1117 to stabilize it ([[PDF] LM1117 800-mA, Low-Dropout Linear Regulator - Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm1117.pdf#:~:text=A%20minimum%20of%2010,the%20transient%20response%20and%20stability)). Use a capacitor type recommended by the LM1117 datasheet (tantalum or electrolytic). The BOM’s 10 µF presumably serves this purpose. Also place a **0.1 µF ceramic** in parallel with the 10 µF, close to the regulator output pin, to shunt high-frequency noise. Similarly, a 0.1 µF near the regulator input (in parallel with the 470 µF) helps with high-frequency filtering of the rectifier diodes’ switching transients.

- **Decoupling and Layout:** Each IC (microcontroller, sensor, etc.) should have a **0.1 µF decoupling capacitor** across its power pins (as close as possible). For the ATmega168P, typically one between VCC and GND, and one between AVCC and GND (which we already noted). The pressure sensors may also benefit from a small decoupling cap near their supply pins. The LCD module typically has some decoupling on board, but adding a 0.1 µF at its Vcc pin won’t hurt. Good decoupling prevents digital switching noise (from microcontroller, LCD toggling, etc.) from disturbing the analog readings or causing erratic behavior.

- **Analog Reference and Grounding:** If very stable analog readings are required, using the **TLV431** as a reference could improve precision. For instance, TLV431 could be set to output 4.096 V as AREF, and the ADC configured to use external AREF. Then the 0–100 kPa (0.2–4.7 V) span would nearly use the full ADC range. However, note that if AVCC (which powers sensor and ADC) sags, the sensor output will sag too, and using AVCC as reference actually compensates that. Using an external reference means supply variations would show up in readings. Thus, **for ratio-metric sensors, using AVcc as ADC reference is actually desirable**. The TLV431 could instead be used as an over-voltage protector or precision 2.5 V reference for other purposes (not heavily needed here). It might even be part of a **brown-out detection** circuit: for example, TLV431 driving the gate of 2N7002 could create a simple voltage supervisor that resets or signals when 5V is out of range. The ATmega168P itself has an internal **Brown-Out Detector (BOD)** that can be set via fuses (to e.g. 4.3 V) to reset the MCU if Vcc falls below that. Enabling BOD would be wise so the MCU doesn’t operate in an undefined state if 5V drops (for instance, if the supply is collapsing or heavily loaded by the triac firing causing dips). If using BOD, ensure the regulator can maintain 5V above the threshold during normal operation.

- **Current Consumption and Thermal:** Estimate currents: ATmega at 8 MHz ~ few mA; sensors ~7 mA each (per datasheet, MPXV5100 ~7 mA supply ([MPXV5100GC6U NXP Semiconductors - All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/electronic-components/datasheet/MPXV5100GC6U--NXP-Semiconductors/#:~:text=Technical%20Specifications%20%3B%20Min%20Supply,Analog%20Voltage%20%3B%20Output))); LCD without backlight ~2 mA, with backlight maybe 15 mA; optocoupler LED when on ~10 mA; MOSFET load – depends (could be anything, let’s assume something like 50 mA motor); Triac opto and gate draw negligible current from 5V (only opto LED draws 10 mA, the triac gate is fed from AC line, not 5V). Summing roughly: ~5+7+7+2+15+10+50 = 96 mA (worst-case with everything on). Likely average is lower. The LM1117 will dissipate (Vin-5)*I. If Vin = 12 V, drop = 7 V. At 0.1 A, that’s 0.7 W. The TO-220 package can handle that with moderate heat sinking (the ground plane can serve as a heat spreader if the tab is ground or use a small heatsink; the thermal resistance junction-to-ambient ~50°C/W with no heatsink, so 0.7 W would raise ~35°C above ambient – a bit warm but okay at room temp, borderline in hot environment). If the MOSFET drives something larger (like 200 mA), then current could be ~0.25 A including everything, and dissipation ~1.75 W – which is too high for LM1117 without a proper heatsink. So keep loads moderate or consider a switching regulator if needed (not in BOM, so likely loads are small). The pressure sensors and MCU are the main steady currents; those are fine.

- **Noise and Transients:** The triac switching an AC load can introduce noise on the mains and potentially coupled noise into the low-voltage circuitry (via electromagnetic coupling). The **RC snubber** across the triac will suppress high-frequency transients from inductive load switching ([Arduino Controlled Light Dimmer : 16 Steps - Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-controlled-light-dimmer-The-circuit/#:~:text=This%20snubber%20circuit%20is%20there,inductive)). The **MOV** clamps extreme surges (like lightning or switching surges). Additionally, one could put a small **RC filter on the gate drive** of the triac or zero-cross detection (if present) to avoid false triggers. Our design uses the values (15 Ω + 0.22 µF) which are relatively strong snubbing (for reference, at 60 Hz, 0.22 µF has about 12 kΩ reactance, so combined with 15 Ω, it’s mostly capacitive; it will allow a few mA of AC through continuously, slightly heating the resistor, but helping keep the triac off until intended). Ensure the resistor is at least 1 W and flameproof (to handle surges), and the capacitor is X2 safety rated (for across AC use).

On the DC side, the **BAT54A/BAV70 diodes** can protect against reverse currents or act as clamp diodes for any inductive kickback. For example, if the MOSFET’s load is a relay coil connected to +12 V (which is higher than 5V logic), a BAV70 from the MOSFET gate to ground could clamp any gate voltage spikes, but more importantly, a flyback diode across the coil (as we did) is needed. The **MMBZ5225B (3.0 V zener)** could be used to protect an analog input or as a transient suppression for the MOSFET gate if one thought the gate might see spikes – however, with proper flyback diode, the MOSFET gate should not see over-voltage. Alternatively, that zener could be placed on the 5V line to clamp it if it ever rose above 5+ some margin, but that’s unlikely (maybe they included it as an option to protect ADC inputs or as a reference). Typically a 3 V zener is too low to clamp a 5 V line (it would conduct heavily around 3.15 V and drag 5V down, so that’s not for Vcc). Perhaps the zener is to create a ~3 V reference for something or to simulate a lower logic level if needed. Since it’s in BOM, one potential use: clamp an analog sense line to 3 V so it can be used with the internal 2.56 V reference – but 3 V zener would be sloppy for that. It might remain unused or be a general ESD protection diode. In any case, it’s there if needed to protect any sensitive node by connecting from that node to ground (cathode to node, anode to ground) to clamp high voltage. If not needed, it can be omitted.

- **Connectors:** Ensure to use proper connectors for external connections. For example:
  - A 2-pin or DC jack for the power input (9–12 V DC in).
  - If pressure sensors are off-board (maybe connected via tubing, but electrical connection could be via wires), include headers for sensor pins or ensure they are securely soldered if on-board.
  - The DIP switch is likely onboard (through-hole or SMT).
  - The LCD might connect via a header (16-pin header).
  - The triac will likely be PCB-mounted (MAC223 might be isolated tab or non-isolated, watch out), and the mains connections (to load and incoming line) should be via robust screw terminals or spade connectors. The MOV can be soldered across the line terminals. The board’s AC section should have a fuse holder or you plan to use an external fuse in series with the line to the triac.
  - The MOSFET’s load (if external, say a small pump motor at 12 V) might connect via a header as well. Provide a connector for that load and its supply if different from 5V (e.g., a terminal for an external 12 V that ties ground common but not feeding the 5V regulator).
  - Additionally, a 6-pin ISP header for programming the ATmega168P (MISO, MOSI, SCK, RST, Vcc, GND) is recommended, unless the chip is pre-programmed via Arduino bootloader and serial. If using serial for bootloading, you’d need an FTDI header (with TX/RX on PD0, PD1). However, we used PD0, PD1 for DIP extras possibly; if we need serial programming, we should keep PD0, PD1 free or use them only after programming. For now, assume ISP programming.

- **Thermal (again):** The BOM mentions “thermal components”. Possibly they mean things like a thermal fuse or PTC (none listed explicitly), or just the need for heat dissipation. If a thermal fuse is desired for safety on the AC side, that could be added in series with the load or mains input to prevent fire on sustained over-current (the triac should be sized correctly though). The MAC223A8 itself will need a heatsink if switching large loads. Provide mounting holes or clips for a heatsink, or mount it to a metal chassis (with insulation if needed). The regulator as discussed might need one if current is high. Ensure spacing so that any heatsink on the triac doesn’t short anything (especially if triac tab is live). The optocoupler and MCU don’t generate significant heat.

In summary, follow good power design practices: **stabilize** the supply (caps close to regulators and loads), **protect** against surges (MOV, snubber on AC, diodes on DC inductive loads), and **account for worst-case** currents and ambient temperatures to avoid overheating. The design as given should operate reliably if these guidelines are implemented.

## High-Speed Code Design Recommendations

When integrating many components in a microcontroller system, efficient code design is crucial, especially for tasks that need to happen quickly or simultaneously. Here are recommendations to ensure the code runs fast and reliably:

- **Use Interrupts for Timing-Critical Events:** If your application requires precise timing or fast reaction to external events, use hardware interrupts. For example, controlling the TRIAC for phase-angle AC dimming requires knowing the zero-cross instant of the AC waveform. You could use an **external interrupt** (INT0/INT1 on PD2/PD3) with a zero-cross detector circuit to get an interrupt at each mains zero crossing. The ISR would then reset a timer or schedule the TRIAC firing after a calculated delay (to achieve the desired phase angle). Using interrupts here is far more efficient and accurate than trying to poll the mains in a loop (which would be unreliable and imprecise). In our current design, we handled the TRIAC in a simple on/off manner, but if we needed fine control, an approach would be: use a timer (say Timer1) in CTC mode to time out the firing delay after a zero-cross interrupt, then in that timer’s ISR, pulse the `triacPin` HIGH for a few hundred microseconds to trigger the opto, then LOW. This would allow dimming with high resolution. Similarly, if we had an **encoder or high-frequency input**, an interrupt on a pin-change or INTx should be used rather than polling, to avoid missing pulses.

- **Efficient Polling for Non-Critical Tasks:** Not everything needs an ISR. Polling is fine for things like reading a DIP switch or checking a sensor that changes slowly ([Sagar Kanjariya | 24 comments - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sagar-kanjariya_interrupt-polling-microcontroller-activity-7066602437972754432-QrQ_#:~:text=Sagar%20Kanjariya%20,can%20create%20multitasking%20on%20microcontroller)) ([Maximize Arduino Sketch Performance with Key Tips - MoldStud](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-maximize-arduino-sketch-performance-with-key-tips#:~:text=Maximize%20Arduino%20Sketch%20Performance%20with,read%20at%20intervals%20or)). The key is to do it efficiently and not too frequently. In our loop, we read analog and digital inputs and update outputs at ~5 Hz, which is very low frequency – this is efficient and leaves plenty of CPU time free. If we needed to poll faster, the ATmega168P at 8 MHz can handle quite a lot in one loop. Just ensure the loop doesn’t have long blocking calls. **Avoid using `delay()` for long periods** in the final design, as it blocks the CPU entirely. Instead, implement timed events via the `millis()` timer. For example, to update the LCD 5 times a second, you could do:
  ```cpp
  unsigned long lastLCDupdate = 0;
  const unsigned long LCD_INTERVAL = 200;
  ...
  loop() {
    unsigned long now = millis();
    if (now - lastLCDupdate >= LCD_INTERVAL) {
      lastLCDupdate = now;
      // update LCD
    }
    // other checks and tasks...
  }
  ```
  This way, the loop can run fast and handle other things concurrently (like checking DIP or driving outputs) without being stuck waiting. This technique of **non-blocking delays** allows efficient polling – do things only when needed ([Enhance Your Arduino Sketch Efficiency with Key Optimization Techniques | MoldStud](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-maximize-arduino-sketch-performance-with-key-tips#:~:text=Use%20efficient%20polling%20methods%20and,in%20projects%20involving%20multiple%20sensors)).

- **Keep ISRs Short and Simple:** When you do use interrupts, handle only the time-critical work in the ISR (interrupt service routine). Set a flag or buffer data, then handle the bulk of processing in the main loop. For example, if an external interrupt signals a zero-cross, the ISR might just set a `zeroCrossDetected=true;` and return immediately. The main loop (or a timer ISR) then uses that flag to schedule triac firing. This prevents spending too much time in an ISR, which could block other interrupts (like the timer for PWM, etc.) or cause jitter.

- **Leverage Hardware Peripherals:** The ATmega168P has several useful hardware modules:
  - **Timers:** We used `analogWrite` on PD6 which uses Timer0 for PWM automatically. For more precise control, you could directly configure timers. For instance, Timer1 (16-bit) could be used to generate an interrupt at a specific time after zero-cross for triac firing. Or Timer2 could run an interrupt every 1 ms to create a system tick. Using hardware timers offloads timing work from the CPU.
  - **ADC Auto-trigger:** The ADC can be set to auto-trigger on a timer event or free-run mode. If you needed continuous sampling of sensors at a fixed interval, you could set the ADC auto trigger on, say, Timer0 overflow, and use the ADC Conversion Complete interrupt to read values. In our design, that’s overkill, but for faster sampling or if you had many channels to read sequentially, that could be useful. Given our loop is slow, manual `analogRead` in loop is fine.
  - **Communication Interfaces:** If the design later includes communication (UART, SPI, I²C), use interrupt-driven or DMA (if available) approaches. For UART, the Arduino `Serial` library already uses interrupts under the hood to buffer data, so `Serial.print` is non-blocking up to a point (except when the buffer is full). If implementing your own, ensure not to busy-wait on transmit or receive.

- **Optimize Where Necessary:** High-level Arduino code is convenient but not always the fastest. If certain operations become a bottleneck, consider optimizing:
  - For example, `digitalWrite()` is versatile but takes ~4-5 µs each call. If you need to toggle pins faster, direct port manipulation is much faster (a single instruction, 62.5 ns at 16 MHz). In our case, we don’t need that speed. But if, say, you wanted to generate a 100 kHz waveform on a pin, you’d either use hardware PWM or directly flip PORTx bits rather than call digitalWrite in a tight loop.
  - Likewise, floating-point math on an 8-bit MCU is slow (hundreds of cycles). If you find yourself needing to optimize, try to use integer math. For pressure conversion, we could have scaled everything by 10 to preserve one decimal and use integers. But since our loop isn’t time-critical, using float is acceptable here. Always consider the trade-off: clarity vs performance.
  - Arrays and loops can be used to tidy code (like reading DIP pins in a loop instead of four separate reads), but the overhead of a small loop is negligible. If you were reading 100 sensors, loop approach is a must (with arrays or structs to hold pin configs). For our small case, either is fine.

- **Efficient Sensor Sampling:** You might not need to read sensors every loop iteration if the loop is very fast. For example, pressure might only need to be updated 10 times per second. If your main loop runs at 100+ Hz doing other tasks, you can sample the ADC at a lower rate using the non-blocking approach mentioned. This reduces redundant ADC reads and gives more time to other tasks. However, if the loop is already slow, it's a non-issue.

- **Debouncing and State Change Detection:** If you have mechanical inputs (buttons, DIP switches, etc.) that might bounce or you only care when they change, you can implement a check to see if the input changed from last state and then act. This can avoid repeatedly running code on each loop when an input is continuously ON. For DIP switches, it doesn’t matter much, but for something like a momentary button triggering an action, you often only want to trigger once per press. Arduino provides `digitalRead` but the logic to track last state is up to you. An efficient approach is:
  ```cpp
  static uint8_t lastDipState = 0;
  uint8_t currentDipState = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<4; ++i) {
    currentDipState |= (digitalRead(dip1Pin + i) == LOW) ? (1<<i) : 0;
  }
  uint8_t changed = currentDipState ^ lastDipState;
  if(changed) {
    // one or more DIP bits changed, handle accordingly
  }
  lastDipState = currentDipState;

  This uses bitwise operations to compact the DIP states, which is efficient. But for simplicity, we handled DIP logic directly. The concept is to avoid unnecessary processing of static inputs.

- **Prioritize Tasks:** If some tasks are more important (e.g., safety cutoff on pressure, or maintaining a stable speed control), ensure in code that those checks happen with sufficient frequency and not blocked by less important tasks (like updating an LCD or printing debug info). For instance, if an overpressure condition should instantly cut off the triac, you might check the sensor reading each loop and if above threshold, immediately kill the triac output (and maybe use an interrupt on an analog comparator for faster hardware response). Meanwhile, less critical tasks like refreshing a display can be done at lower priority or rate.

- **Power-Saving (if applicable):** In many embedded systems, you may want to save power by sleeping the CPU when idle. This might not be relevant if the device is mains-powered (which it is in our case, via the regulator), but if you had a battery scenario, using `sleep_mode()` and waking on interrupts (like on a timer or pin change) could dramatically reduce consumption. The ATmega168P can sleep in idle while timers run, or in ADC noise reduction mode while sampling, etc. Since we have a triac on mains, power is likely not an issue here.

- **Testing and Calibration:** Incorporate means to calibrate or adjust without stopping the system. For instance, one DIP switch could put the system in a test mode where it prints raw values to Serial for calibration. Or use the serial interface to tweak parameters. This doesn’t directly affect speed, but is good practice for verifying that your efficient code is also correct. Efficient code that’s wrong is just fast at doing the wrong thing! So always test the logic with expected scenarios.

In summary, structure your code in a **non-blocking** way where possible, use interrupts for the things that absolutely require them (timing critical or can’t be missed events), and keep the main loop running fast enough to handle everything else in a timely manner ([Sagar Kanjariya | 24 comments - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sagar-kanjariya_interrupt-polling-microcontroller-activity-7066602437972754432-QrQ_#:~:text=,can%20create%20multitasking%20on%20microcontroller)). The Arduino framework allows a hybrid approach: use its easy functions for most things, and drop down to register-level for specific needs. We have already leveraged PWM hardware and could use interrupts if needed for the triac.

Given our design's needs (which are moderate speed), the provided example code is sufficient. But if, say, we wanted to integrate a faster control loop (like a PID loop at 100 Hz for pressure, plus triac phase control at 120 Hz), we would definitely use timer interrupts for scheduling those actions rather than relying on `delay`.

One should also be mindful of **simultaneous operations**: for example, if you were updating the LCD at the exact moment an interrupt tries to fire the triac, slight timing jitter might occur (since `lcd.print` takes some micromilliseconds, during which interrupts are enabled but if an ISR tries to also use the same shared resource like `digitalWrite` (which it shouldn’t), or if it just needs to happen at a precise microsecond, there could be minor latency). In most cases, ATmega can handle these overlapping tasks because the time scales are different (LCD updates at ms scale, triac timing at 100µs scale tolerance). But when in doubt, test under load (lots of serial prints, etc.) to ensure critical timing still holds.

By following these practices, the system will be responsive and reliable:
- The microcontroller will promptly react to high-priority events (like turning off outputs if a threshold is passed).
- No unnecessary CPU cycles will be wasted spinning on unneeded loops or delays – it will **“use efficient polling methods and limit the frequency of data readings…read at intervals or upon specific triggers” ([Enhance Your Arduino Sketch Efficiency with Key Optimization Techniques | MoldStud](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-maximize-arduino-sketch-performance-with-key-tips#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20sensor%20management%20plays%20a,in%20projects%20involving%20multiple%20sensors))** as appropriate.
- The code will be easier to maintain since each part has a clear role (e.g., an ISR only sets a flag, the loop handles logic, etc.). This modular approach helps in debugging and extending functionality.

Lastly, always profile or simulate timing if the application is borderline. In our integrated design, we have ample headroom on an 8-bit MCU, but as features grow (say we add more sensors or communication), keep an eye on loop execution time. Tools like toggling a pin at loop start/end and measuring on a scope can tell you loop frequency, or printing `micros()` difference.

By adhering to these guidelines, the ATmega168P can comfortably manage the sensing, display, and control tasks concurrently, providing a robust embedded solution.
