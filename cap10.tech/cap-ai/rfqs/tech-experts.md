    <p>Hello Tech Expert Guys Team,</p>
    <p>
      I hope you’re doing well. My name is <strong>Bill Nortman</strong>, and I’m in the process of starting a new personal AI company. I came across your full-service technology consulting and support solutions and was impressed by your capabilities. I’m looking to build a partnership that can help bring my high-performance workstation vision to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I have a couple of leads lined up and plan to build two prototype systems to get started. If these go well, I’m aiming to sell five units in the first quarter, and potentially ramp up to around 25 systems over the coming year—if not more, depending on demand.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the core specifications I’m working with for the prototypes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (16 cores, 32 threads)</li>
      <li><strong>GPUs:</strong> Dual Nvidia RTX 5090</li>
      <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E (or a similar high-performance board)</li>
      <li><strong>Memory:</strong> 256GB DDR5</li>
      <li><strong>Primary Storage:</strong> Samsung 990 Pro 4TB NVMe SSD</li>
      <li><strong>Bulk Storage:</strong> Two 10TB Western Digital Red Pro HDDs in a mirrored configuration</li>
      <li><strong>NVMe RAID Expansion:</strong> HighPoint SSD7101A‑1 RAID Controller (for four additional NVMe SSDs in RAID 10)</li>
      <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Custom water‑cooling loop (oversized reservoir, water blocks for CPU & GPUs, high-capacity radiator)</li>
      <li><strong>PSU &amp; Case:</strong> EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 T2 in a full-tower chassis (e.g., Lian Li PC‑O11 Dynamic XL)</li>
      <li><strong>Software Environment:</strong> Windows 11 Pro, pre-configured with my AI/automation stack</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I’d value your insight on these specifications, especially regarding:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Warranty &amp; Support:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>How you handle hardware warranties, maintenance, and ongoing support.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Volume Pricing &amp; Partnership:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Any potential discounts or long-term benefits for scaling production beyond the initial prototypes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deployment &amp; Logistics:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Best practices for assembly, shipping, and potential on-site or remote setup services.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I believe there’s a strong opportunity here to form a mutually beneficial partnership—one that leverages your expertise in delivering robust, high-end systems and my vision for a new wave of personal AI solutions.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
    <p>Warm regards,</p>
