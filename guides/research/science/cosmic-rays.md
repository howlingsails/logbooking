# Cosmic Rays and Bit Flips: A Global Overview

Cosmic rays from outer space are constantly bombarding the Earth, and they can *flip* bits in electronic devices – a type of *soft error* known as a **single-event upset (SEU)** ([This Week in Glean: What Flips Your Bit? – Data@Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2022/04/13/this-week-in-glean-what-flips-your-bit/#:~:text=Well%2C%20from%20the%20same%20Wikipedia,a%200%20or%20vice%20versa)) ([statistics - Cosmic Rays: what is the probability they will affect a program? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580933/cosmic-rays-what-is-the-probability-they-will-affect-a-program#:~:text=,15)). In simple terms, a 0 in memory can turn into a 1, or vice versa, due to an energetic particle strike. These cosmic-ray-induced bit flips are a **terrestrial reality**: they have been caught scrambling computer data and even altering real-world events (for example, a stray cosmic particle added **4096 false votes** in a 2003 Belgian election tally ([Documented case of a cosmic bit flip](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/05/20/cosmic-rays-flipping-bits/#:~:text=Radiolab%20did%20an%20episode%20on,when%20they%20reran%20the%20tally))). From smartphones and laptops to servers and IoT gadgets, **all digital devices are susceptible** to these rare but impactful “bit flips.”

**Why do cosmic rays flip bits?** When high-energy cosmic particles (typically protons or heavy nuclei) crash into Earth’s upper atmosphere, they generate cascades of secondary particles (neutrons, pions, muons, etc.) that shower toward the ground ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=O%E2%80%99Gorman%20collide%20with%20the%20nuclei,particle%20flux%2C%20mostly%20neutrons%20and)) ([ APOD: 2023 December 5 – Energetic Particle Strikes the Earth  
](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap231205.html#:~:text=particle%2C%20as%20do%20all%20cosmic,air%20showers%20are%20common%20enough)). At ground level, the **high-energy neutrons** in this secondary shower are the main culprits for soft errors ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=of%20secondary%20particles%20that%20includes,An%20ion%20travelling%20through%20the)). If one of these particles strikes a semiconductor chip, it can knock loose a burst of charge – enough to toggle the state of a memory cell or logic latch. Notably, this process **does not damage the hardware**; it simply alters the data bit held in that circuit ([Soft error - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20types%20of,in%20addressing%20or%20processing%20program)). The effect is transient, but in computing even a single-bit error can cause glitches, crashes, or corrupt data if unmitigated. Highly reliable systems therefore employ error-correcting codes to detect or fix these flips on the fly ([Soft error - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#:~:text=If%20detected%2C%20a%20soft%20error,it%20may%20be%20impossible%20to)).

## Which Devices Are Affected?

**All types of digital devices** can experience cosmic-ray bit flips – there’s nothing inherently special about a phone versus a server when it comes to fundamental physics. Any device containing semiconductor memory or logic (which is virtually every modern electronic device) is vulnerable. This includes:

- **Smartphones and tablets** – with gigabytes of DRAM or flash memory where flips can alter stored data or running apps.
- **Laptops and desktop PCs** – more memory and larger circuits mean more “bit cells” that could be hit by a particle.
- **Servers and cloud datacenters** – packing massive amounts of RAM and CPUs, they experience flips regularly (as we’ll see, many datacenters see *corrected* single-bit errors frequently ([Memory testing on ECC RAM - are ECC errors "ok"? - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/memory-testing-on-ecc-ram-are-ecc-errors-ok.1501484/#:~:text=Technica%20arstechnica,not%20like%20CEs%20are%20rare))).
- **Embedded/IoT devices** – from automotive controllers to smart appliances and sensors. Even if these have smaller memories, they are not immune (there are documented cases of avionics and engine controllers glitching due to cosmic SEUs ([Bit Flips](https://code7700.com/bit_flips.htm#:~:text=EEC%20internal%20faults%20can%20be,EEC%20Power%20off%20Reset))).

In essence, **if it’s electronic and has memory, a cosmic ray can flip a bit in it**. The likelihood is extremely low for any given bit, but with billions of devices and trillions of bits, flips *do* happen. A famous study by IBM in the 1990s found about **1 cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 MB of RAM per month** on average ([statistics - Cosmic Rays: what is the probability they will affect a program? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580933/cosmic-rays-what-is-the-probability-they-will-affect-a-program#:~:text=From%20Wikipedia%3A)). That works out to roughly **1 flipped bit per 8 GB of memory per day at sea level** ([

](https://ineffectivetheory.com/cosmic-rays-dns-bitflips/#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20do%20some%20crude%20estimation,seconds%20of%20opportunity)). For a typical computer or phone with a few GB of RAM, this means a cosmic bit flip might occur **once every few days** in that device, statistically speaking. (Most go unnoticed thanks to error-correction and the fact that not every bit flip causes a visible failure.)

However, this cosmic bit flip rate is **not uniform around the globe**. One major factor influencing it is altitude. The higher you go, the thinner the atmosphere above, and thus the more intense the cosmic ray bombardment. Let’s break down cosmic-ray exposure and error rates by altitude – from sea level to high mountain elevations – and see how different regions (and their billions of devices) fare.

## Cosmic Radiation by Altitude: Sea Level vs. Mountain Heights

The Earth’s atmosphere acts as a shield, absorbing most primary cosmic rays before they reach the surface ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=O%E2%80%99Gorman%20collide%20with%20the%20nuclei,particle%20flux%2C%20mostly%20neutrons%20and)). At **sea level**, we enjoy the most protection (roughly 99% of cosmic radiation is attenuated by the air overhead ([[PDF] Terrestrial Cosmic Ray Induced Soft Errors and Large-Scale FPGA ...](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1562&context=spacegrant#:~:text=Less%20than%201,produce%20muons%2C%20protons%2C%20neutrons))). At **higher altitudes**, that shield is thinner, so more high-energy neutrons and particles penetrate to ground. **Soft error rates increase with altitude** accordingly ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)). In fact, experiments have shown that at an elevation of ~3,000 m, cosmic-ray-induced error rates can be *over ten times* higher than at sea level ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)). Even a moderate elevation around 1,500–2,000 m sees a significant uptick in neutron flux (on the order of 2–3× higher SER rates than sea level) ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=were%20responsible%20for%20a%20significant,energy%20range%20from%2010%20to)). As one aerospace manufacturer succinctly noted regarding unexplained avionics faults: *“An SEU can be caused by cosmic rays... Upsets are random in nature but more susceptible at higher altitudes.”* ([Bit Flips](https://code7700.com/bit_flips.htm#:~:text=EEC%20internal%20faults%20can%20be,EEC%20Power%20off%20Reset))

Let’s consider three altitude bands – low (sea level), mid, and high – and examine their cosmic ray exposure and impact on devices. For each band, we’ll look at example cities (with populations and devices), estimate how many devices operate there and their memory sizes, and approximate the bit flip rates they experience. We’ll also contrast **uncorrected vs. corrected** error rates, since error-correcting codes (ECC) in devices like servers greatly reduce the **impact** of these flips (even if the flips themselves happen regardless of ECC).

### Low Altitude (Sea Level) Regions

**Sea-level band:** roughly 0 to 500 m elevation. This includes most of the world’s great population centers. In fact, about **73.7% of the world’s population lives within 500 m of sea level** ([Article Summary: “The Distribution of Human Population by Altitude” by Cohen and Small – The Ratchet of Technology, a site by Michael Magoon](https://techratchet.com/2020/04/11/article-summary-the-distribution-of-human-population-by-altitude-by-cohen-small/#:~:text=,of%20Mexico%20and%20the%20Andes)), clustering in coastal and lowland cities. Example cities in this band include:

| City               | Altitude (m) | Population (approx)  |
|--------------------|-------------:|---------------------:|
| **New York City, USA**   | ~10 m       | ~8.4 million       |
| **Tokyo, Japan**        | ~40 m       | ~14 million        |
| **Mumbai, India**       | ~14 m       | ~12.5 million      |
| **London, UK**          | ~11 m       | ~9 million         |
| **Lagos, Nigeria**      | ~15 m       | ~14 million        |

These five cities alone house over 50 million people, and collectively, **billions** of digital devices. Globally at sea level, on the order of ~5–6 **billion people** (over 70% of humanity) reside in this low-altitude band ([Article Summary: “The Distribution of Human Population by Altitude” by Cohen and Small – The Ratchet of Technology, a site by Michael Magoon](https://techratchet.com/2020/04/11/article-summary-the-distribution-of-human-population-by-altitude-by-cohen-small/#:~:text=,of%20Mexico%20and%20the%20Andes)). Device ownership is widespread here: there are easily **several billion smartphones** in use, plus billions more computers, servers, and IoT devices concentrated in low-altitude regions. For rough estimation, consider: if ~75% of the world’s ~6 billion smartphones, ~1 billion PCs, and the vast majority of data center servers are at low altitudes, this band contains perhaps **~10 billion active digital devices** in total (many small “smart” gadgets in homes and industry, in addition to personal and enterprise devices).

- **Typical memory sizes:** A modern smartphone might have ~4 GB of RAM; a laptop or desktop ~8 GB; a server in a data center 64 GB or more (often much more); an IoT sensor or embedded controller maybe from a few MB up to a few hundred MB.
- **Cosmic ray flux:** At sea level, neutron flux is relatively low – about **14 neutrons/cm²/hour** at New York’s latitude, for example ([Soft error - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#:~:text=Cosmic%20ray%20flux%20depends%20on,In%20the%20lower)). This corresponds to the baseline soft error rate observed by IBM and others. Recall the **IBM study**: ~1 bit flip per 256 MB per month, i.e. ~**4 flips per GB per month** ([statistics - Cosmic Rays: what is the probability they will affect a program? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580933/cosmic-rays-what-is-the-probability-they-will-affect-a-program#:~:text=,15)). That is ~0.13 flips/GB per day, or ~**0.005 flips per GB per hour** (a convenient rate for calculations) ([statistics - Cosmic Rays: what is the probability they will affect a program? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580933/cosmic-rays-what-is-the-probability-they-will-affect-a-program#:~:text=,15)) ([

Using that rate, we can estimate **bit flip frequency** for various devices at sea level:

- **Smartphone (4 GB RAM):** 4 GB × 0.005 flips/GB/hr ≈ **0.02 flips per hour** on average. In other words, *roughly one bit flip every two days* in a typical phone at sea level ([

  Do cosmic rays cause domain name bit-flips? | Ineffective Theory

](https://ineffectivetheory.com/cosmic-rays-dns-bitflips/#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20do%20some%20crude%20estimation,seconds%20of%20opportunity)).
- **Laptop/PC (8 GB):** ~0.04 flips per hour (~one flip every day).
- **Server (64 GB):** ~0.32 flips per hour (about **1 bit flip every 3 hours** per server). A large data center with thousands of servers will see dozens of raw bit flips each hour, even at sea level.
- **Small IoT device (0.1 GB or ~100 MB):** 0.1×0.005 = 0.0005 flips/hour (one flip every ~83 days for a single small device).

Now, in practice many of these errors **don’t cause harm**. Why? Two reasons: **(1)** not every flipped bit matters (it might be in an unused part of memory or in data that isn’t mission-critical), and **(2)** **error-correcting memory**. Most smartphones and consumer gadgets **do NOT use ECC** memory, so any flip is “uncorrected” (though software or redundancy might catch some). PCs also generally run without ECC (unless it’s a high-end workstation). **Servers, however, almost always use ECC RAM**, which can correct a single-bit error on the fly ([Error Detection and Correction » ADMIN Magazine](https://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Monitoring-Memory-Errors#:~:text=The%20standard%20ECC%20memory%20used,11011100%29%20for%20some%20reason)). That means a 64 GB server might experience 8 or so *raw* flips a day, but almost all of those get corrected invisibly. (Google’s server fleet studies have shown that correctable single-bit errors occur quite frequently – on the order of 20,000–50,000 correctable errors per billion hours of DIMM operation – yet serious **uncorrectable** errors are far rarer ([Memory testing on ECC RAM - are ECC errors "ok"? - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/memory-testing-on-ecc-ram-are-ecc-errors-ok.1501484/#:~:text=Technica%20arstechnica,not%20like%20CEs%20are%20rare)). In one large-scale study, around **8–10% of DIMMs** in servers recorded correctable errors over a year ([Memory testing on ECC RAM - are ECC errors "ok"? - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/memory-testing-on-ecc-ram-are-ecc-errors-ok.1501484/#:~:text=Technica%20arstechnica,not%20like%20CEs%20are%20rare)), whereas a much smaller fraction suffered any data corruption.) In summary, **uncorrected error rates** at sea level are extremely low for well-protected systems – perhaps on the order of 1 per several years for a PC, and even lower for a server with ECC. But the **raw bit flips** are indeed happening millions of times a day across the world’s sea-level devices.

**Total flips per hour (sea level):** Given the huge number of devices, the aggregate flips are surprisingly large. Suppose ~10 billion devices averaging ~4 GB each are powered on; at 0.005 flips/GB/hr, that’s on the order of **200 million bit flips per hour** globally in low-altitude regions (rough estimate). The **vast majority** of these 10^8 flips cause no visible issue – either they’re corrected by ECC or occur in unimportant bits. But this figure puts in perspective the sheer scale of cosmic-ray interactions with electronics. The *universe is literally flipping bits in our devices* on the order of **thousands per second**, and yet our digital world mostly trudges along unaffected, thanks to engineering safeguards.

### Mid-Altitude Regions (500–2000 m)

**Mid-altitude band:** roughly 500 m to 2000 m elevation. This band includes many highland cities and upland areas around the world. While not as densely populated as coastal lowlands, mid-altitude regions still host a significant slice of humanity (mountainous parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas). In fact, there is a “broad bulge” in global population between ~1500–3500 m elevation, contributed largely by populous highland areas in places like Mexico, Ethiopia, and South-Central Asia ([Article Summary: “The Distribution of Human Population by Altitude” by Cohen and Small – The Ratchet of Technology, a site by Michael Magoon](https://techratchet.com/2020/04/11/article-summary-the-distribution-of-human-population-by-altitude-by-cohen-small/#:~:text=despite%20the%20area%20being%20only,of%20the%20total%20land%20area)). An estimated **1–2 billion people** (≈20–25% of world population) live between 500 m and 2000+ m. Five example cities in this altitude range:

| City                    | Altitude (m) | Population (approx) |
|-------------------------|-------------:|--------------------:|
| **Denver, USA**         | ~1,600 m    | ~3 million (metro)  |
| **Nairobi, Kenya**      | ~1,795 m    | ~4.5 million        |
| **Bengaluru (Bangalore), India** | ~920 m     | ~8+ million        |
| **Tehran, Iran**        | ~1,200 m    | ~8.7 million        |
| **Santiago, Chile**     | ~520 m     | ~5.6 million        |

These cities illustrate mid-altitude locales on different continents. Many of them are major urban/tech centers (Bengaluru is India’s tech hub, Denver has many data centers and labs, etc.), so device penetration is high. We can assume on the order of **hundreds of millions of devices** in this altitude band globally (perhaps ~15–20% of the world’s smartphones and PCs).

- **Cosmic ray flux:** At these elevations, the atmosphere is thinner. By ~1500 m, the cosmic neutron flux might be roughly **2× higher** than at sea level, and by ~2000–2500 m it could be **3–4× higher** ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)). (The exact factor depends on geomagnetic latitude and other factors, but a doubling or more is reasonable around 1–2 km elevation.) In one classic study, moving DRAM tests from sea level (~30 m) to ~1.6 km altitude (Boulder, CO) significantly increased the observed soft error rate, and going up to ~3.1 km saw a >10× jump ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)). So mid-altitude lies in between – let’s ballpark **3× the sea-level bit flip rate** for mid-alt (~0.015 flips/GB/hr instead of 0.005).
- **Device error rates:** Using that factor, a 4 GB phone at, say, 1500 m might see ~0.06 flips/hour (one bit flip every ~16–17 hours on average, versus ~48 hours at sea level). An 8 GB laptop might expect ~0.12 flips/hour (~1 flip every 8 hours). This is still quite low probability in absolute terms – but notably higher than at sea level. For a city like **Nairobi (1795 m)** or **Mexico City (2250 m, just above this band)**, a person’s PC might experience a few *noticeable* soft errors per year, whereas the same PC at sea level might go many years without an obvious incident.
- **ECC and corrections:** The story remains similar: most critical systems in these cities (e.g. cloud servers in Denver) use ECC memory, correcting the majority of single-bit flips. However, mid-altitude environments can reveal weaknesses more readily if ECC isn’t present. For instance, a consumer device with no ECC that might *rarely* glitch at sea level could see a couple of mysterious crashes a year in a place like Bogotá or Addis Ababa due to cosmic flips. It’s no coincidence that some high-altitude cities have reported higher rates of unexplained electronics glitches. Tech companies have even performed tests by hauling hardware up to mountaintops to accelerate soft-error testing ([Effect of Cosmic Rays on Computer Memories - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.206.4420.776#:~:text=Effect%20of%20Cosmic%20Rays%20on,less%20sensitive%20to%20cosmic%20rays)) ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)).

In terms of **aggregate flips**, mid-altitude regions have fewer total devices than sea-level, but each device flips bits a few times more often. These two factors partially offset. For example, if ~1.5 billion devices operate in this band with an average memory size of ~4 GB, and a 3× higher flip rate, one can estimate on the order of **tens of millions of flips per hour** occurring across all mid-altitude devices. Our rough calculation might be ~90 million flips/hour globally for 500–2000 m regions (assuming ~1.5 billion devices at 0.015 flips/GB/hr, similar to earlier sea-level estimate) – a bit lower than the sea-level total, but the **per-device risk** is clearly elevated.

### High Altitude Regions (> 2000 m)

**High-altitude band:** elevations above ~2000 m. This includes mountainous cities and plateaus – e.g. the Andes Altiplano, parts of the Himalayas/Tibetan Plateau, Ethiopian highlands, and the highest cities of North America. These regions host a much smaller population overall. Only about **1–2% of humanity lives above 2500 m** (roughly 80 million people globally) ([
Global and country-level estimates of human population at high altitude - PMC
](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8106311/#:~:text=We%20used%20georeferenced%20population%20and,Research%20is%20encouraged%20in%20countries)), and even including 2000–2500 m, the total is on the order of a few hundred million at most. Five example high-altitude cities:

| City                   | Altitude (m) | Population (approx)   |
|------------------------|-------------:|----------------------:|
| **Mexico City, Mexico**| ~2,250 m    | ~9 million (21M metro) |
| **Bogotá, Colombia**   | ~2,640 m    | ~8 million             |
| **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia** | ~2,355 m | ~3.4 million           |
| **La Paz, Bolivia**    | ~3,640 m    | ~800,000 (with El Alto ~1.7M metro) |
| **Lhasa, Tibet (China)** | ~3,650 m  | ~200,000               |

Despite their thin air, some of these cities are major capitals or megacities (Mexico City and Bogotá are huge). So high-altitude doesn’t always mean low-tech: Mexico City alone has tens of millions of devices in active use. Still, globally the **device count** in this band is much smaller than at low altitude – perhaps only a few hundred million total devices. Notably, large-scale cloud data centers are rarely located at extreme altitudes, in part because of reliability concerns. (Organizations like Google and IBM prefer to build data centers closer to sea level, where cosmic SER is lower – though other factors like cooling and cosmic ray exposure for avionics also come into play.)

- **Cosmic ray flux:** As altitude increases, cosmic radiation intensifies dramatically. By 2000–3000 m, we’re seeing several-fold increases. At **3,600 m** (e.g. La Paz or Lhasa), cosmic neutron flux can be on the order of **10× or more the sea-level rate** ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=were%20responsible%20for%20a%20significant,energy%20range%20from%2010%20to)). (The IBM study recorded >10× higher soft-error rates at 3.1 km vs 0 km ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)).) So for this band, we’ll assume ~**5–10× the sea-level flip rate** depending on the exact altitude. Let’s take 8× as a rough middle for calculations (~0.04 flips/GB/hr).
- **Device error rates:** At 8–10× the baseline, the numbers become more foreboding. A **4 GB phone in a high-alt city** might experience ~0.2 flips/hour – that’s **one bit flip every 5 hours or so** on average. An **8 GB laptop** could see ~0.4 flips/hour (~one flip every 2.5 hours). Without ECC, each of those flips could potentially cause a crash or error if it hits the wrong place. In real terms, someone running a PC in La Paz might encounter weird unexplained glitches multiple times per year (or even per month) if their system lacks robust error correction or if they run memory-intensive, sensitive tasks. High-altitude residents have indeed reported **higher instances of unexplained computer crashes**, consistent with the physics. NASA and other agencies routinely test electronics at high-altitude labs (or send them on high-alt balloon flights) to simulate years’ worth of cosmic ray exposure in a short time ([Effect of Cosmic Rays on Computer Memories - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.206.4420.776#:~:text=Effect%20of%20Cosmic%20Rays%20on,less%20sensitive%20to%20cosmic%20rays)).
- **ECC vs uncorrected:** In these harsh cosmic conditions, ECC memory is even more valuable. A server running in Bogotá with ECC might correct dozens of single-bit errors a day in its 64 GB of RAM, with the user never knowing. The **uncorrected error rate** (multi-bit upsets that ECC can’t fix) will be somewhat higher here than at sea level, but still rare – perhaps on the order of one uncorrectable error in a given module every few years or so. However, a **non-ECC system at 3000 m** could be borderline unstable, depending on its margin for error. It’s not a surprise that critical infrastructure at high altitude (e.g. telescopes, mountain-top labs) often use radiation-hardened components or ECC-protected systems. Even commercial airliners, which cruise at ~10,000–12,000 m (where cosmic radiation is *another order of magnitude* higher yet), have to design avionic computers to handle cosmic events – there have been incidents where cosmic rays likely flipped bits in flight computers, requiring resets mid-air ([Bit Flips](https://code7700.com/bit_flips.htm#:~:text=EEC%20internal%20faults%20can%20be,EEC%20Power%20off%20Reset)).

**Total flips per hour (high alt):** Because relatively fewer devices operate at extreme altitudes, the global total bit flips in this band is smallest – perhaps on the order of **tens of millions per hour**. Our rough estimate might be ~30–40 million flips/hour for >2000 m regions. That is lower than the sea-level band’s ~150+ million/hour, reflecting the smaller population. However, on a *per capita/device basis*, high-altitude users are getting zapped far more. The bit flip *density* per device is highest in this band by far.

### Comparing Altitudes: Bit Flip Rates and Impact

To summarize the scaling with altitude:

- **Per-bit/per-device error rate:** Increases with altitude. At 1–2 km, roughly 2–3× higher than sea level; at ~3+ km, on the order of 10× higher ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=were%20responsible%20for%20a%20significant,energy%20range%20from%2010%20to)). In practical terms, a given device might go from one flip a month at sea level to several flips a month at mid-alt, to several flips a week at high alt. At commercial airline altitude (~10–12 km), the rate is yet another 10× or more higher – cosmic radiation is significant enough that frequent flyers and avionics systems alike accumulate notable exposure (passengers on long flights receive radiation doses, and avionic computers experience many particle strikes) ([Cosmic Radiation](https://cdp.dhs.gov/shared/se/courses/default/AWR-923-W%2005122021%201.2-20210512144644/groups/62.html#:~:text=The%20level%20of%20exposure%20to,Consequently%2C%20someone)). Fortunately, most consumer electronics don’t operate at 12 km – but satellites and spacecraft do, and they use very robust radiation-hardened designs for that reason.

- **Total global flips:** Sea-level regions dominate simply because that’s where most devices are. Even though an individual phone in Lhasa might flip bits 10× more often than one in London, there are *so many more* devices in London (and at sea level generally) that the **bulk of cosmic-ray bit flips worldwide happen near sea level**. It’s a bit ironic: the safest areas per device still contribute the most flips in aggregate. Mid-altitude areas contribute a substantial share too. High-altitude areas contribute the least total flips (few people), but each device there shoulders a much bigger “cosmic ray burden.”

- **Uncorrected vs corrected errors:** Across all altitudes, **error-correcting codes make a huge difference** in the *observed* failure rates. The *raw bit flip* rates we’ve been discussing scale with altitude as above. But systems equipped with ECC memory or other mitigation might experience **zero *visible* errors** even if hundreds of bits flip internally (all corrected). For instance, a cloud server farm at 3 km altitude might log numerous ECC corrections per day but suffer no downtime, whereas a personal PC at 3 km with no ECC could crash a few times a year from those same flips. Google’s studies famously revealed that many memory errors in servers are *single-bit errors that get corrected* silently ([Memory testing on ECC RAM - are ECC errors "ok"? - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/memory-testing-on-ecc-ram-are-ecc-errors-ok.1501484/#:~:text=Technica%20arstechnica,not%20like%20CEs%20are%20rare)). The adoption of ECC varies by device category: nearly all servers use ECC (so **corrected error rates** are the meaningful metric for them), while nearly all mobile and IoT gadgets do not (so **uncorrected = raw** in those cases). Desktop PCs fall in between (most consumer PCs lack ECC, unless they are special-purpose). The net effect is that enterprise systems tend to be resilient across altitudes – they *see* more errors at high alt, but handle them. Consumer devices at high alt are more likely to exhibit the effects (unless manufacturers start putting ECC in all our phones in the future).

## Conclusions

Every hour of every day, **cosmic rays are flipping bits** in our digital devices all around the world. It’s a fascinating intersection of astrophysics and everyday technology: a star exploding millions of years ago can ultimately cause your smartphone app to crash by flipping a single bit in memory! Fortunately, engineers have developed ways to cope – from ECC memory that corrects errors on the fly ([Error Detection and Correction » ADMIN Magazine](https://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Monitoring-Memory-Errors#:~:text=The%20source%20of%20bit,primarily%20neutrons%20from%20cosmic%20rays)), to robust software that can handle random faults. For most of us at or near sea level, cosmic-ray bit flips are an ultra-rare, almost negligible threat (perhaps one flip in a specific device every few years might cause a visible issue). At higher elevations, the risk per device creeps up, and it’s something high-altitude industries and residents have learned to mitigate or simply accept (rebooting a glitchy router on a mountain top now and then).

**Altitude is a key factor** in cosmic-ray-induced errors: as altitude increases, atmospheric shielding decreases and bit flips surge (roughly doubling with each couple of kilometers in elevation) ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)). Sea level remains the safest zone, while mountaintops and aircraft face the highest rates. Yet interestingly, because the vast majority of digital devices are near sea level, **most cosmic bit flips overall occur in those low-altitude devices** – even though each device is safer, the sheer number of devices means the total flips are greatest at sea level. Conversely, a lone laptop in La Paz faces a much greater chance of a flip than one in London, but there are far fewer laptops in La Paz.

In practical terms, **all device categories – phones, servers, IoT – must be designed with cosmic rays in mind**, especially as technology scales down to ever-smaller transistors (smaller bits need less energy to flip). Vendors routinely test memory chips at high altitude or using particle accelerators to ensure reliability ([Effect of Cosmic Rays on Computer Memories - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.206.4420.776#:~:text=Effect%20of%20Cosmic%20Rays%20on,less%20sensitive%20to%20cosmic%20rays)). Techniques like ECC, parity checks, and redundancy have become standard in critical systems, precisely to handle cosmic “glitches” that would otherwise be undetectable. And research by companies like IBM, Google, and NASA continues to refine our understanding of these phenomena ([This Week in Glean: What Flips Your Bit? – Data@Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2022/04/13/this-week-in-glean-what-flips-your-bit/#:~:text=I%20did%20a%20little%20research,well%20as%20the%20effect%20of)) ([](https://downloads.regulations.gov/NHTSA-2012-0038-0031/attachment_1.pdf#:~:text=as%20a%20function%20of%20altitude,of%20the%20SER%20plotted%20against)).

The next time your computer crashes or your phone behaves oddly, you might jokingly blame “cosmic rays.” Amazingly, in a small fraction of cases, you **could be right**. It’s reassuring, though, that in the **cosmic battle between radiation and our computers**, we have the tools to keep our bits mostly in line – from the ocean shores to the highest city in the clouds.
