## üóíÔ∏è **Cap10Bill‚Äôs Design Patterns Key Terms Guide**

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They‚Äôre like navigational charts‚Äîguiding you through stormy code and ensuring your vessel sails smoothly.

---

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.

**Real-World Example:**  
The captain of a ship‚Äîyou wouldn‚Äôt have more than one commanding officer at the helm.

**Digital Example:**  
A configuration manager or logging system in an application where a single instance coordinates operations.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Singleton {
    - static instance: Singleton
    + getInstance(): Singleton
  }
```

---

### 2. **Factory Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Real-World Example:**  
A burger joint where the chef prepares different types of burgers based on your order, without you knowing the secret recipe.

**Digital Example:**  
A factory method that generates various objects (e.g., different types of user notifications) based on input parameters.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product {
      <<interface>>
    }
    class ConcreteProductA
    class ConcreteProductB
    Product <|-- ConcreteProductA
    Product <|-- ConcreteProductB
    class Creator {
      + factoryMethod(): Product
    }
```

---

### 3. **Observer Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

**Real-World Example:**  
A news broadcast where subscribers receive updates as soon as news breaks.

**Digital Example:**  
Event listeners in a GUI application, where multiple components react to a change in a data model.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
      + registerObserver(observer: Observer)
      + notifyObservers()
    }
    class Observer {
      <<interface>>
      + update()
    }
    class ConcreteObserver1
    class ConcreteObserver2
    Subject "1" -- "many" Observer : manages
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver1
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver2
```

---

### 4. **Decorator Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

**Real-World Example:**  
Customizing a pizza by adding extra toppings‚Äîyou start with a base pizza and add ingredients as desired.

**Digital Example:**  
Enhancing a UI component by wrapping it with additional features, such as scrollbars or borders, at runtime.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
      <<interface>>
      + operation()
    }
    class ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    class Decorator {
      - component: Component
      + operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
```

---

### 5. **Strategy Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

**Real-World Example:**  
A navigation system that offers multiple routes (fastest, shortest, most scenic) and lets you choose the best one based on current conditions.

**Digital Example:**  
A sorting library that can switch between different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) based on the dataset size.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Strategy {
      <<interface>>
      + execute()
    }
    class ConcreteStrategyA
    class ConcreteStrategyB
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyA
    Strategy <|-- ConcreteStrategyB
    class Context {
      - strategy: Strategy
      + setStrategy(strategy: Strategy)
      + executeStrategy()
    }
```

---

### 6. **Adapter Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another.

**Real-World Example:**  
A power adapter that converts the plug type of your device to match the socket in a foreign country.

**Digital Example:**  
An adapter class that enables a new module to work with legacy systems by translating its interface.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Target {
      <<interface>>
      + request()
    }
    class Adaptee {
      + specificRequest()
    }
    class Adapter {
      - adaptee: Adaptee
      + request()
    }
    Target <|-- Adapter
```

## üóíÔ∏è **Cap10Bill‚Äôs Additional Design Patterns Guide**

### 1. **Builder Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**Real-World Example:**  
Imagine a car factory where you can choose different features‚Äîsunroof, leather seats, sport package‚Äîwithout changing the assembly line's process.

**Digital Example:**  
A UI builder that constructs complex forms with various optional components based on user input.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product {
      + parts: List~String~
      + listParts()
    }
    class Builder {
      <<interface>>
      + buildPartA()
      + buildPartB()
      + getResult(): Product
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder
    Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder
    class Director {
      - builder: Builder
      + setBuilder(builder: Builder)
      + construct()
    }
```

---

### 2. **Template Method Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This lets subclasses redefine certain steps without changing the overall algorithm‚Äôs structure.

**Real-World Example:**  
Think of a standardized cooking recipe where the overall process is fixed, but the chef can add personal flair at certain steps.

**Digital Example:**  
An abstract class for data processing where the sequence is fixed but data parsing or formatting is implemented by subclasses.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractClass {
      + templateMethod()
      - primitiveOperation1()
      - primitiveOperation2()
    }
    class ConcreteClassA
    class ConcreteClassB
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClassA
    AbstractClass <|-- ConcreteClassB
```

---

### 3. **Command Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations; it also supports undoable operations.

**Real-World Example:**  
A remote control that stores commands (turn on, turn off, change channel) which can be executed or undone at the press of a button.

**Digital Example:**  
A GUI framework where each button click encapsulates a command to be executed, logged, or even undone.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Command {
      <<interface>>
      + execute()
    }
    class ConcreteCommandA
    class ConcreteCommandB
    Command <|-- ConcreteCommandA
    Command <|-- ConcreteCommandB
    class Invoker {
      + setCommand(command: Command)
      + executeCommand()
    }
    class Receiver {
      + action()
    }
    Invoker --> Command
    Command --> Receiver
```

---

### 4. **Composite Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A structural pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Real-World Example:**  
A file system where folders (composites) and files (leaves) are treated uniformly for operations like listing contents or searching.

**Digital Example:**  
A graphical UI framework where widgets can be composed into panels, and panels into windows, all following the same interface.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
      <<interface>>
      + operation()
    }
    class Leaf {
      + operation()
    }
    class Composite {
      + add(component: Component)
      + remove(component: Component)
      + operation()
    }
    Component <|-- Leaf
    Component <|-- Composite
    Composite "1" o-- "*" Component : contains
```

---

### 5. **Facade Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use without exposing the underlying complexities.

**Real-World Example:**  
A universal remote that controls your TV, DVD, and sound system through one easy interface, hiding all the intricate wiring and codes.

**Digital Example:**  
An API that simplifies interactions with a complex library or multiple microservices, presenting a unified interface to the client.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Facade {
      + operation()
    }
    class SubsystemA {
      + operationA()
    }
    class SubsystemB {
      + operationB()
    }
    Facade --> SubsystemA
    Facade --> SubsystemB
```

---

### 6. **Proxy Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, or add additional functionality.

**Real-World Example:**  
A travel agent who handles bookings on your behalf, ensuring you get the best deal without dealing directly with airlines.

**Digital Example:**  
A virtual proxy for a large image that loads only when needed, reducing resource usage and latency.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
      <<interface>>
      + request()
    }
    class RealSubject {
      + request()
    }
    class Proxy {
      - realSubject: RealSubject
      + request()
    }
    Subject <|-- RealSubject
    Subject <|-- Proxy
    Proxy --> RealSubject
```

---

### 7. **Iterator Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Real-World Example:**  
A playlist where you can iterate over songs without knowing how they‚Äôre stored on your device.

**Digital Example:**  
A collection in a programming language (like an array or list) that offers an iterator to traverse its elements one by one.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Iterator {
      <<interface>>
      + hasNext(): Boolean
      + next(): Object
    }
    class ConcreteIterator {
      + hasNext(): Boolean
      + next(): Object
    }
    class Aggregate {
      <<interface>>
      + createIterator(): Iterator
    }
    class ConcreteAggregate {
      + createIterator(): Iterator
    }
    Aggregate <|-- ConcreteAggregate
    Iterator <|-- ConcreteIterator
```

---

### 8. **Mediator Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing them from referring to each other directly.

**Real-World Example:**  
An air traffic control tower coordinating between various aircraft to ensure safe takeoffs and landings.

**Digital Example:**  
A central message broker that manages communication between microservices in a distributed system.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mediator {
      <<interface>>
      + notify(sender: Object, event: String)
    }
    class ConcreteMediator {
      + notify(sender: Object, event: String)
    }
    class Colleague {
      <<interface>>
      + setMediator(mediator: Mediator)
    }
    class ConcreteColleagueA
    class ConcreteColleagueB
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleagueA
    Colleague <|-- ConcreteColleagueB
    ConcreteMediator --> ConcreteColleagueA
    ConcreteMediator --> ConcreteColleagueB
```

---

### 9. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

**What it is:**  
Allows multiple objects to handle a request without coupling the sender to a specific receiver. The request is passed along a chain until an object handles it.

**Real-World Example:**  
A customer support system where a complaint is escalated through multiple tiers until it‚Äôs resolved.

**Digital Example:**  
A logging framework where different handlers process log messages based on severity levels until one handles the output.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Handler {
      <<interface>>
      + setNext(handler: Handler)
      + handle(request: String)
    }
    class ConcreteHandlerA {
      + handle(request: String)
    }
    class ConcreteHandlerB {
      + handle(request: String)
    }
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandlerA
    Handler <|-- ConcreteHandlerB
    ConcreteHandlerA --> Handler : next
    ConcreteHandlerB --> Handler : next
```

## üóíÔ∏è **Cap10Bill‚Äôs Additional Design Patterns Guide**

### 1. **Flyweight Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A structural pattern that minimizes memory usage by sharing common data among similar objects.

**Real-World Example:**  
Consider a typographer using a single stamp for the letter "A" across thousands of pages‚Äîeach "A" shares the same design, saving resources.

**Digital Example:**  
Rendering a document where each character is an object sharing the same intrinsic state (font data), rather than loading thousands of duplicate objects.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Flyweight {
      + operation(extrinsicState)
    }
    class ConcreteFlyweight
    Flyweight <|-- ConcreteFlyweight
    class FlyweightFactory {
      + getFlyweight(key): Flyweight
    }
```

---

### 2. **State Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating state-specific logic.

**Real-World Example:**  
A traffic light that shifts from red to green to yellow‚Äîits behavior changes based on its current state.

**Digital Example:**  
A context object in a software application that behaves differently depending on its current state (e.g., a media player that switches from play to pause to stop).

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
      - state: State
      + request()
      + setState(state: State)
    }
    class State {
      <<interface>>
      + handle(context: Context)
    }
    class ConcreteStateA
    class ConcreteStateB
    State <|-- ConcreteStateA
    State <|-- ConcreteStateB
    Context --> State : uses
```

---

### 3. **Memento Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that captures and externalizes an object‚Äôs internal state, allowing the object to be restored later without breaking encapsulation.

**Real-World Example:**  
A save point in a video game that records your progress so you can revert to it if needed.

**Digital Example:**  
An undo mechanism in a text editor where the current state is saved as a memento, letting you roll back changes.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Originator {
      - state: String
      + createMemento(): Memento
      + restore(m: Memento)
    }
    class Memento {
      - state: String
      + getState(): String
    }
    class Caretaker {
      - memento: Memento
      + setMemento(m: Memento)
      + getMemento(): Memento
    }
    Originator --> Memento
    Caretaker --> Memento
```

---

### 4. **Visitor Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that separates an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates, allowing you to add new operations without modifying the classes.

**Real-World Example:**  
An inspector visiting different departments within a company, evaluating each one without altering their internal structure.

**Digital Example:**  
A compiler traversing an abstract syntax tree (AST) to perform operations like optimization or code generation without changing the AST's classes.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Element {
      <<interface>>
      + accept(visitor: Visitor)
    }
    class ConcreteElementA
    class ConcreteElementB
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementA
    Element <|-- ConcreteElementB
    class Visitor {
      <<interface>>
      + visitConcreteElementA(element: ConcreteElementA)
      + visitConcreteElementB(element: ConcreteElementB)
    }
    class ConcreteVisitor
    Visitor <|-- ConcreteVisitor
    ConcreteElementA --> Visitor : accepts
    ConcreteElementB --> Visitor : accepts
```

---

### 5. **Bridge Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A structural pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.

**Real-World Example:**  
A TV remote that can control different brands of TVs‚Äîthe remote (abstraction) works independently of the TV's internal mechanics (implementation).

**Digital Example:**  
A graphic application that separates shape definitions from the rendering engine, enabling different rendering methods without changing the shape code.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Abstraction {
      - implementor: Implementor
      + operation()
    }
    class Implementor {
      <<interface>>
      + operationImpl()
    }
    class ConcreteImplementorA
    class ConcreteImplementorB
    Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementorA
    Implementor <|-- ConcreteImplementorB
    Abstraction --> Implementor
```

---

### 6. **Interpreter Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions, often used to interpret sentences in a language.

**Real-World Example:**  
A calculator interpreting arithmetic expressions to compute results.

**Digital Example:**  
An interpreter for a domain-specific language (DSL) that parses and evaluates commands for a configuration system.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractExpression {
      <<interface>>
      + interpret(context: String): int
    }
    class TerminalExpression
    class NonTerminalExpression
    AbstractExpression <|-- TerminalExpression
    AbstractExpression <|-- NonTerminalExpression
```

      <<interface>>
    }
    class ConcreteProductA1
    class ConcreteProductB1
    ConcreteFactory1 --> ConcreteProductA1
    ConcreteFactory1 --> ConcreteProductB1
```

---

### 2. **Prototype Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A creational pattern that creates new objects by cloning an existing prototype, saving the overhead of re-creation.

**Real-World Example:**  
A photocopier replicating a document‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to create each page from scratch.

**Digital Example:**  
Cloning objects in a game engine for multiple non-player characters (NPCs) that share similar properties.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Prototype {
      <<interface>>
      + clone(): Prototype
    }
    class ConcretePrototype
    Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype
```

---

### 3. **Null Object Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A behavioral pattern that provides a benign, do-nothing object in place of a null reference, avoiding the need for null checks.

**Real-World Example:**  
A placeholder actor in a play that silently fills in when no one is scheduled‚Äîensuring the show goes on without interruption.

**Digital Example:**  
A logger that, instead of returning null, returns an object with empty implementations to safely absorb calls without side effects.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AbstractAction {
      <<interface>>
      + execute()
    }
    class RealAction
    class NullAction
    AbstractAction <|-- RealAction
    AbstractAction <|-- NullAction
```

---

### 4. **Repository Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A design pattern that encapsulates data access logic, providing a centralized place to perform CRUD operations while abstracting the data layer.

**Real-World Example:**  
A librarian who organizes, stores, and retrieves books for you without revealing the complex cataloging system.

**Digital Example:**  
A repository class that abstracts database operations, offering a simple interface to manage user records.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Repository {
      <<interface>>
      + add(entity)
      + remove(entity)
      + find(id): Entity
    }
    class ConcreteRepository
    Repository <|-- ConcreteRepository
```

---

### 5. **Unit of Work Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A pattern that tracks changes to objects during a business transaction, coordinating the writing of changes as a single atomic operation.

**Real-World Example:**  
A project manager who tracks multiple tasks and coordinates their completion before final delivery.

**Digital Example:**  
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that batches database operations‚Äîensuring that all changes are committed together, or none at all.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class UnitOfWork {
      + registerNew(entity)
      + registerDirty(entity)
      + commit()
    }
```

---

### 6. **Service Locator Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A design pattern that abstracts the process of obtaining service instances, offering a central registry for accessing various services.

**Real-World Example:**  
A phone directory that helps you locate any service provider you need without knowing their exact details upfront.

**Digital Example:**  
A service locator that provides access to logging, configuration, or messaging services in an application, decoupling the client from the instantiation process.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ServiceLocator {
      + getService(serviceName): Service
    }
    class Service {
      <<interface>>
      + execute()
    }
    class ConcreteService
    Service <|-- ConcreteService
```

---

### 7. **Specification Pattern**

**What it is:**  
A pattern that encapsulates business rules and criteria that an object must satisfy, allowing you to combine and reuse specifications.

**Real-World Example:**  
A job candidate screening process where multiple criteria are used to determine if a candidate meets the requirements.

**Digital Example:**  
A filtering system in an e-commerce platform where products are selected based on specifications like price range, category, and rating.

**Mermaid Diagram:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Specification {
      <<interface>>
      + isSatisfiedBy(candidate): Boolean
    }
    class ConcreteSpecification
    Specification <|-- ConcreteSpecification
```
