What makes some teams? Some companies More Innovative than others, what makes some teams more productive than others? What makes some teams win more often than others? What makes some teams more engaging than others In the world that I inhabit? So, I'm an organizational psychologist by training. I'm a recovering academic, I was a full-time business school professor for the better part of a decade and in the world that I exist in, we have really two answers historically to those questions. You probably thought of these answers a little bit as well. The the first answer we have to this question Is usually where most it's actually where most people go thinking about what makes teams more successful than others. Most teams go to talent, right? Do they go to this idea? Okay, we just get more talented people, right? We can have a better team, we get more. We get star players, right? Pick pick your sport. There is a team who's entire strategy, right? Is to blow out the budget and acquire as many star players as possible. And then pick your sport. That team loses more often than not to other teams. It's a little confusing, isn't it? And it turns out there's a reason for that in research. Now, the reason is that Talent isn't portable? It's not portable the way we think it is. It turns out from a wealth of research in a variety of different Industries? When you take a star player and you pick them up and you move them to another team. What happens more often than not? Is that the performance of that? Star player, diminishes. We've seen that in whatever your favorite sport is, right? But it turns out the performance of their teammates diminish as well, and in a corporate setting the performance and the valuation of the entire company, diminishes as well, Talent isn't portable, because Talent and turning talent into performance, actually, depends incredibly on the team that somebody is on performance, is a team sport. And by the way, if if I may, if I could be so bold, even if Talent were portable, it's not exactly. Um, Available right now, Right? Doesn't really feel like it's easily acquireable. Anyway, even if it was. So this is a losing strategy on on two levels In terms of trying to get our team into a high performing team. The other strategy that gets talked about in my world far too often. Uh, is probably this one. If Talent isn't portable then we turn our attention to tame building. All right, we go to team building and so we decide. Okay, let's uh let's get all our people together for a team building activity. We're gonna go do a ropes course, right? Or a trust fall. Nobody's behind me. I have nobody, I can trust. We're gonna get everybody together. Okay, we're gonna take a personality test you ever done this, right? We're gonna take a personality test and we're gonna find out that that Bob, is this letter or series of letters and Sarah, is this color my personality, by the way, my Myers brings type is NSFW. Some of you'll get that later. Um, we we find out that this person's Enneagram is, you know, nine Wing Pie. What I don't even understand, right? And then and then we all feel good. We have a great discussion about differences and then Nothing changes. You're been in that situation. I mean it's weird right? Because we know We know what it's been like to work on a team where everything clicked where everything was high performing, we all have an experience of working for the best team ever. Some of us that experience hasn't even been in our career. It's maybe it was like your collegiate life or maybe it was a sports team, you were on in high school right? My Collegiate life was a little bit different. In fact, I haven't, um, I have it in my will that when I die the six members from my senior thesis team are going to be the pall barrels in my funeral because I need them to let me down one more time. Some of us, Some of us have that experience and then we try and replicate it either through Talent or through team building and we're like what is going on? Why can't we make this team that we currently have feel like that best team that we were ever on? Well, the team building thing, it turns out it can work some of the time and some of you gave me that little like stink eye. When I said it doesn't work this is this is for you. What we know from a myriad of research is that different team building on activities things that take people off site and bring them through shared experiences or discussions about personality differences, Etc. Those things can work if They managed to change the habits and Norms of behaviors of the team, when you get back to the day-to-day work, another way to think about that. Is this team building isn't an activity. It's a habit. It's a series of norms. It's a habits of behavior that our teams exhibit And it, it turns out, we, we actually already have a word for habits and Norms and teams of paper. We already have a word for that. Um, these two talked about it earlier, we call that word culture. So today I'm going to talk to you about John's 3. No, They're not John's. They're pretty good. We have our word for its culture. And so today, what I want to talk to you about is what the research says about a culture of a high performing team because it turns out, they're all actually pretty similar That when you look at high performing teams across a variety of Industries And sporting Endeavors in a private Endeavors in military and even in non-profit and government work. When you look at teams that outperform their peers, They all have a culture that looks kind of the same And that culture is marked by three elements. Three, cultural Dimensions, three cultural personality. Thank you for taking a picture. It's just a triangle though. Um, There are better slides. You can take a picture of later but I it's a good. It's a good triangle. I got it. I didn't need a graphic designer I made that triangle myself. So, cultures on high performing teams are marked by three elements. A sense of common, understanding a sense of psychological safety and a sense of pro-social purpose. The members of the team have these three things going on in their Norms of behavior in their mentality, and their approach to work common understanding. Psychological. Safety pro-social purpose. Now, you know why? I told you earlier. I'm a business school professor, those really academic sounding terms, aren't they? So what I want to do, in the time that we have together is I want to Define those terms For each one. I want to tell you why they're so important. And then I want to do what most professors don't do. I want to give you some practical applications that you can do today Or tomorrow. You know what? Actually, I'll tell you what Monday. I'll give all of you the weekend off. When you get done with these, when you get, you know get over the hangover from the party. Etc. Find something to change out of from that plaid and then and then we'll get to work on building these. So I'm going to do that. Is that work for you? All right, so let's start with this common understanding. What is common understanding? Well, this is an academic term for this. Is the extent to which team members have a commonly held perspective. On the teams, expertise to sign tasks context preferences. Yeah, this is a definitional size. This is actually a good one to take a picture of, so that's cool. Um, What does this mean? Well, this is a term that was, uh, sort of modified from a body of research by a brilliant woman name. Martin Haas, and Martin Haas, study teams at a variety of different formats. And she came up with this idea of common understanding, or shared understanding, we might think of this as two elements, not just one. So, common understanding on the first part of it, team's expertise assigned task context. We might call this Clarity, I know what my role is, I know what your role is and I know how our rules fit together. I have an understanding of my roles my responsibilities but also yours, I have an understanding. What the deliverables are. I understand the NAT chart, I got it all down, right? I know how all of the pieces fit together. That's Clarity. But what Martin Haas found was that? That was only half the picture. The other half, is this context and preferences piece that we might call. If that's Clarity we might call this Empathy That I understand more about you than just what your job description is and whether or not you're doing it or not. I understand who you are as a human. I understand your background. I understand your strengths and weaknesses. Empathy is I think what we're trying to get at, but these little personality tests and those sort of things, but it can become deeper than that. And you usually don't have to pay a lot of money to testing companies, which is like double whim, right? We might call it empathy, You know, the thing about this, just in the context and preferences piece, just in the empathy piece, right? Different people have different preferences. You don't have to have. Like the think about the very first time you got a work related email address For some of you you know, that was like we can't even say how long ago, Right? For some of you I don't know. Maybe that was like a week ago. You don't have to have one for very long before you realize it, different people use this tool differently, don't they? They have different preferences about how to use it, some people. Um, some people are what we might call email. Um, novelists, You know, the types Four or five paragraphs long? They, they remember how to construct the five paragraph essay from 10th grade, right? So they've got a thesis statement at the top and then they've got three supporting points, and then a conclusion, right? And then other people, they're not novelists, they're more like um, they're more like email Poets, They write in Haiku. Sounds good. You know what I'm talking about? The people whose signature lying is longer than the emails. They compose. And some of them are really vague, you forgotten that email, maybe you sent this email like we need to talk 

10:16 AM
And some of them are really vague, you forgotten that email, maybe you sent this email like we need to talk 

10:16 AM
And some of them are really vague, you forgotten that email, maybe you sent this email like we need to talk 

What is that even mean? Right? Is, is there a problem? Am I getting promoted? Am I getting fired? How do I respond to that, right? And then, if you have an understanding of people's preferences though, you know, either, oh yeah, they're they're the Haiku person. I don't want to read too much into this. They're just doing it from their phone, Etc. And then you understand the novelist, and let's just, let's see another one for him. Some people don't exactly adhere to the the standard rules of email of, like, let's email during work hours, right? Some of those are the late night. Even any late night emailers in the room. Just you want to self-identify confess, right? That can be a problem unless your team has a sense of common understanding. And they know that like oh yeah that's just that's what works for them. They don't like sleep or something. They're a vampire So that works and like the good kind of empire too like from Twilight. Um, So we know that that's their thing and I won't feel personal about it but if I don't know if I don't have to use yourself identified in your on the front row, that's the only reason I'm picking on you. So you made the choice twice. I figured safe If they don't then they look at him and they go, I'll let jerk right. Oh now I'm like now. You wait? Or if if you catch it late at night, if not you wake up, first thing in the morning and you check your phone, you're like, oh my gosh. Now I have to respond to the email novel before I can even get on. Get to work. But if I have an understanding of, that's just the way you are no problem, right? So if we build this into empathy in this sense of common understanding, we can collaborate a whole lot better on a team when I think about the importance of common understanding and the research behind it. One of my favorite examples Of common understanding is this guy you may or not recognize him because there's a floating bubble in his face. But this is Chris Hatfield. Canadian astronaut. Chris Hatfield. If you if the if I move the bubble and you make out the mustache, you might recognize him from his famous lip syncs of David Bowie. I did tell you, there would be lip syncing. I warned you, You might recognize him from his viral Facebook videos, and things like that. He was probably the first, uh, astronaut on the International Space Station, who became an actual celebrity, But he's a celebrity inside the space Community as well. Inside NASA and the Canadian Space Agency and even the Russian space agency, He's known as one of the most successful commanders of an international space station Mission ever. People line up to want to be emissions that are led by Chris back when he was leading. And one of the reasons for that is he understood the power of pairing Clarity, with empathy, it wasn't just making sure roles and responsibilities NASA has tons of checklists and all sorts. There's all sorts of role Clarity stuff to do, but he wanted to make sure he understood the people. He'd be living in a tin. Can circling the Earth. 90, once every 90 minutes, he wanted to make sure he understood those people and Chris like on one mission. Chris was leading a team of five including himself, two Americans, two Russians in himself. So think about this for a second from like a just a pure empathy and differences standpoint. We have five people living in a tin. Can circling the Earth, Every 90 minutes, Two of them are Russian two of Americans, one of them's Canadians. So there's three different cultures going on, Right? We're rushing culture, American culture, and Canadian culture, which is like American culture. But nicer We have three the Canadians identify themselves. Thank you, We have three different languages being spoken, right? Because we have Russian. We have English and then we have American. All right, so we've all sorts of these differences. The Americans identify themselves, all right? And Chris knew we had to build that sense of empathy. So he went above and beyond, he actually moved in with the Russian cosmonauts for a time learned to speak Russian drag. A whole lot of vodka. Moved in with the Americans learned how to speak American drink. A whole lot of Coca-Cola. Whatever. Uh Budweiser I don't know More importantly, he wanted the team to have a sense of empathy with each other and so he had them talk about their differences, their preferences, he actually even had them, he went so far for example as to role play how they would respond in different scenarios. If disasters happen, including one time, where they role played, how they would support each other, if one of the members of their mission had lost a, um, A member of their close personal family, While they were in space, Which actually happened One of the astronauts lost, the closed family member, and the only four people he had to support him through that to help him grieve where the astronauts that Chris had prepared. So that's what I mean, when I say common understanding is more than just making sure people know how to do their job. It's making sure they know how their job fits into everybody else's job. And making sure they understand the people Behind those jobs. Oh, you're probably not going to space. Maybe you're working with Russians. Maybe you're working with Canadians. Hopefully, you're not working with Americans. I'm an American. I can make that joke But you still need to build this sense of common understanding. So how do we do it? Here's a couple of different ideas for you and how we can build that sense of common understanding. Number one Is what I like to call huddles. Uh, if you've had any familiarity with the world of agile software development, you might recognize when I'm about to say is a scrum, but scrum is a rugby term and I have no idea how that game works. I thought baseball was hard enough to follow, then I tried to follow rugby. No offense to the Aussies So in a huddle the idea in a scrum in a daily stand-up and agiles that every single day when a coding team is working together, they would meet very briefly in the morning and they would answer three questions for each other, not reporting to the boss, but to each other three questions. What did I work on yesterday? What did I complete? What am I focused on today And what's blocking my progress? And I love the Simplicity of those questions. And on the majority of teams and organizations that I work with, I encourage them to adopt some other Rhythm doesn't have to be daily, doesn't even have to be a meeting. Imagine this is a simple email or a simple. Check in every Monday. Where everybody reports? Okay, Here's where I am on a little projects. Here's what I did last week last week. Here's what I'm focused on this week, It's that third question. That's brilliant though, isn't it? Here's what's blocking my progress. One of the biggest complaints I hear from leaders is that they feel like they don't actually lead a team. A lot of times they feel like they're just supervise seven people or 500, people's individual problems. They just made it to individual people and they all come to me for their problems and have a way to the world on my shoulder, right? We didn't know that entrepreneur was also being like Atlas, right? I have to figure all of that out. Well, one of the best ways we can do that. One of the best ways we counteract that, get the team feeling like a team again, is to help them work out loud and the easiest way to work out loud is to actually be broadcasting when you need help when people on your team need help. But, let's be honest, we don't like to ask for help. Do we? And I'm talking to more than just the Americans here. We don't like to ask for help too, because if we feel like maybe it's admitting we're failing. Maybe it's something we're struggling. How often do we go? Do you know what? I'll figure it out. I need to ask for help yet, I'll figure it out. And then three weeks later we finally fall apart And realize. Okay. I needed some help but it would have been a whole lot cheaper and faster to give you help back Downstream, wouldn't it? And so a question like what's blocking my progress coaxes people in to talking about the potential struggles that they're facing without admitting, I need help. I'm failing, Etc. It's like a trick question. It's beautiful. What's blocking my progress. So that's a huddle. You can do the frequency that you want. You can do the medium of communication you want, but think about those three questions. What did I just complete? What am I focused on next? And what's blocking my progress, as a way to get the teams That you lead to check in with each other and work out loud. Number two, is one of my favorite words, probably the favorite word. I'll say this entire talk, it's fika. It's a Swedish word, it translates to have coffee, but if you've ever been to Sweden, if you know anyone from Sweden, if you've ever been invited to fika, you know, that FICA is there's going to be three so you can take a picture if we get to three. I love your enthusiasm though. Thank you. Faker is a Swedish word means to have coffee, but it's a deeper ritual than just have coffee. There are documentaries about the social connection that happens during FICA. If you're ever get to the bottom of Netflix, which I have, because I travel a lot, you'll find those documentaries And most organizations that have worked, especially over the last two years that have been crippling with hybrid and things like that. Have been doing some version of FICA getting people together for one-on-one meeting, maybe once a week with random person on their team or in a different team, in the organization, just to have a non-work conversation to get to know each other to connect a bit better. Some teams, don't do it fika one-on-one. But they take advantage of buffer times unstructured times the time before the meeting when everybody's filing in, and they make sure to see that with questions that help people tell a little bit more of their story. What we do that we find we have certain things in common with each other, we build those bonds. I was in an elevator earlier today with a gentleman who was skipping my keynote to go swimming. I hope he got done swimming. Where are you? There you are from Philadelphia. We bonded over being from Delaware. Yeah, you can give a round of applause. That's fine. He went swimming. 

10:25 AM
He went swimming. 

10:25 AM
He went swimming. 

Wish I could get a round of applause for going swimming. We bonded over the fact that we grew up in the same area, right? That happens. But it only happens to those unstructured times. And one of the weirdest things I don't know if you felt this way in the last two years we've had way too many meetings. Am I right? And here's the weird thing we're because we have so many of them, we're doing them efficiently And when it comes to common understanding that can actually be a problem because we're not taking the time to get to know each other the way we used to when we didn't have another meeting to run off to. So maybe it's not a structured, coffee talk type of thing, maybe it's just taking advantage lingering a bit longer and having those conversations. One of the other rituals I do with a lot of teams where I encourage them to do especially at the start of a team meeting. Like let's say you do your huddle you do it every Monday. Start with what we call an energy check just a quick check going around the table. Hey, on a scale of one to five. What's your energy level? Like this week. Is it a five? Awesome? Are you lying? Is it a two? What can we do to help? Get it up to maybe not to a five. But what could we do to help Just checking in because you know, people bring more than just their brain to work, don't they? They bring a lot of their personal life. This whole idea of a work-life balance thing is ridiculous because it it deposits this idea that we could separate out these two spheres of our life and we can't we bring that stuff with us, Right? Anyone that's ever gotten the phone call from your school because your kid has a fever or in the last two years, cuz your kid was next to a kid who had a fever, and then got a Q-tip jammed, up your nose. And now you've got a week at home Watching the kid, right? You know, that work in life interact and so an energy check just a simple. Hey, what's going on in your life? How's everybody's energy? Level doing this week. One through five. Anything. That's a two or below. Just ask. What can we do to help? What can we do to support them if they don't want to share? That's fine. What they need to know from you. If you're in a leadership role is that you're there for them and your care and you're available. All right, so huddles fika energy Jack, that's all. We've got. So for coming to understand you already got it. Okay. Cool. Let's talk about the next one of the triangle. Let's talk about psychological safety. This is a term, this is the one academic term. You might have heard already before psychological safety, the extent to which team members feel safe to express themselves and to take risks To speak up when they disagree, Right? To try crazy things. And even if they don't work, not feel like it'll reflect poorly on them. Psychological safety is is a fascinating concept. First first discovered by, Or at first really, proven by a brilliant research. And Amy Edmondson, Amy, Edmondson was actually studying hospitals and studying chart, nurses and charge nurses. As leaders on Hospital Awards and found something really interesting which is in the hospital. She was studying all of the best charge nurses. The leaders of the nursing teams, all of the best ones had higher rates of reported accidents than the poor leaders, Which is a little weird, right? You're supposed. If you're good leader, you're supposed to have less accidents, right? Like we're trying to have less screw-ups when we're going through something on the production line, right? So more reported ones. That's that's a little weird. It wasn't until she started doing qualitative interviews with people that she found out. That that word reported is carrying a whole lot of weight. In other words, on the teams where people felt safe to report that they messed up. They did so. And on the teams where people feared their leader, they didn't and besides the massively unethical thing about hiding medical mistakes, it's only on the safe teams that people have the develop, the ability to learn, and to develop, and to grow, Right? So psychological, safety hugely important, not only for making our people feel safe to bring their whole selves to work et cetera, but important for learning as a team and continuously improving as a team as well. I think about psychological safety. One of my favorite stories of psychological. Safety is the story of Alan malali. And the way that Alamalali was tapped to turn around the Ford Motor Company In the mid-2000s Alan was one of the first CEOs, a Ford Not named Fort. And when he was brought in, he was brought in from Boeing, and he was charged with turning the company around the company was on Pace to lose, 17 billion dollars. According to the annual reports For that year before he was brought in, And one of the things Alan was committed to was building a culture of psychological safety where people could actually admit what was going wrong so that we could actually try and fix it And he lived that Candor himself. In fact on his very first day did a press conference like a lot of publicly traded companies, you know, they trot you out in front of a little Podium and they said you're supposed to talk about how you're going to raise the share price. And one of the reporters in the back of the room, asked him a question towards the end of the press conference and hey is he'll kind of car? Do you drive? Now, if you're the CEO of Ford, we what are you supposed to answer? You know what Alex said? I drive a Lexus. It's the finest car on the market Now, unbeknownst to all those reporters. So did all of the other Executives, They just hit it. When Alan was saying because I drive the finest car in the market, I aspired to get our company there, But we're not there yet. And we have to be honest about that. One of the other things he did is he had the senior leadership to meet every Thursday morning for what he called, a business process review. And in a business process review He would have each of the senior leaders of different divisions, talk about where they were that week, what they just completed what they were focused on next and any things that were blocking their progress. Okay. If that sounds like a huddle to you, It's because it's exactly like a huddle. That's where I got the idea And what Alan actually asked him to do was color code their slides in their report. So on the what's blocking my progress, green would mean, nothing, I'm good, everything's fine. Yellow would be and I got some problems. We have a little bit of an idea of how to solve it. Um, So we're okay. And red would mean clueless And on the first he told them all of us ahead of time. He went into the first business process review and this is what he saw A Sea of green lights. Everything's fine. We're good. Keep in mind, we're gonna lose 17 billion dollars, but everything's fine For eight weeks. It went on like this eight weeks, Alan had to sit there and be like, We're gonna lose seven, and you're telling me everything's fine. Surely something's going on that. This room can help solve It wasn't until week nine. That one executive decided to take a risk Mark Fields, who's in charge of production. Um, some of the production in Canada Had a problem in production. They didn't figure out how to solve it on the production line, so they're having to solve it afterwards, having individual mechanics, go in, and fix it, and that was causing massive backlogs, and you didn't know how to solve it. So we took a risk, You change this color to Red And he presented the real problem And the culture of fear that Ford was before Alan came in. You can imagine what happened and it culture where people just lie and put green lights on there. You could imagine what everybody did? They took a good look at Mark Because it was the last time they were ever going to see him With Alan did was a little bit different Alan said this is great. Tell us more about your problem, maybe we can figure it out by the end of the day and they got everybody together and they came up with a plan to kind of test it and get at least a workable plan, for how we can fix the problem And as they were leaving, of course everybody took their last last. Look at Mark Because they knew he was going to be gone but the next week he wasn't gone. In fact, his position at the table had moved. He was sitting Right next to Allen Which is really just a statement. What I want is more of this. I want more of that honesty. So, what happened after the week after they saw Mark? Not only fired But Uh but brought next to Alan. Here's what the slides look like A sea of colors, right? We can, we can finally be honest about what's going on. We can finally fix our problems. Maybe we can turn things around And turn things around. They did During the Great Recession. When the other two big automakers in the United States to bail out money, Ford did not. They kept moving, they kept improving, they kept moving, they kept improving kept committed a psychological safety. When uh, Alan Wally retired. They had moved from losing 17 billion dollars a year To a seven billion dollar Surplus. And when Alan resigned his CEO, he made a recommendation to the board about who should follow him. Do you know who he recommended? You recommended Mark Fields, First person who took that risk, Okay? You might not be tasked with turning around a 17 billion dollar company, You might have not have a bunch of Liars who are trying to see why a on your team. But I sense in your facial expressions that you're thinking, yeah, we could do a little bit more to grow our sense of psychological safety. So here's a couple ideas for you. The first is treat conflict as collaboration especially if you're in a leadership role and people speak up and they disagree with you, it can feel personal, right? Or even if you're not in a leadership role when you submit your idea and somebody else is like, no, I don't think that can work. It can feel like they're kind of attacking you, right? 

10:33 AM
It can feel like they're kind of attacking you, right? 

10:33 AM
It can feel like they're kind of attacking you, right? 

Ideas. We treat them like like babies. There are babies, right And nobody ever calls a baby ugly, Even though some babies are ugly, nobody ever calls a baby ugly. You don't say that. You just know it needs time to grow and nurture, develop or or you say, oh, he looks just like his father. Well, however, you respond right, we don't call it. We know that. So when people push back on our idea, I can feel like they're calling our baby ugly But we need that mindset shift. No, they're not what they're actually saying is, I see something. You don't, I have a different perspective. I have a different background. I have a different set of knowledge skills and abilities and that gives me a different Viewpoint on this problem and I have another idea and I'm seeking to collaborate with you. So we need to be a little more honest about that treat conflict as collaboration when it happens. The next element we could do is we need to try. I think a whole lot more often and Jesse's talk really spoke to this, right? Remember five, new ideas in a session, most of them don't work out, like live pinata night or flatula. It's fun night. Most of them don't work out. We ought to be celebrating failures of it more. And what I mean here When I say celebrate failures is not Congratulations. You were totally inconfident. You screwed up the entire production, we lost a hundred thousand dollars and six months working on the project. Here's the trophy. That's not what I mean, Unless you lead a bunch of Millennials and then it might work. Oh, that's terrible. That's awful. I can't believe I said that. I am a millennial too. Isn't that bad? Is that make it worse? I'm that borderline. Like, we don't, nobody knows, whether I'm, I'm Gen X or Millennial, right? So, not only do, I want people to tell me that I'm super special, but I also want to be left alone, Right? All the Gen X's in the room. Get that. I see you all in the back. I got you. What I mean when I say celebrate failures that in every failure, there's an opportunity to learn. That was one of the lessons that Jesse pulled in today. I actually learned this not from business not from organizational psychology leader. I learned this from 16 years. Practicing this really esoteric martial. Art called Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Any anybody ever or anybody? Watched the UFC last weekend. Okay. Couple you when they are done boxing and they fall down and they hug each other. That's really interesting. Um, like I said really, esoteric. Well, we have a saying in that martial art it exists in a couple other martial arts. Too are saying is that when you're in competition, If you have the spirit of a martial artist you never actually lose. You're only two options or, Or learn If you're too arrogant to pull a lesson from your loss, then maybe you really did lose but most of us have something we can learn from it. So we have a win or learn mentality, but in order to have a real lesson out of it, we need transparency on the team to talk about what my role was. You know what? I made the assumption that we would be able to get this paper in And supply chain. I, I really underestimated supply chain issues. Maybe I, I don't know. Maybe I overestimated them. And as a result, I told the client, uh, a crazy deliverable time, and they went somewhere else because they had a better idea, right. All of us. Make these assumptions every day. We make decisions every day that are based on assumption. Sometimes, they don't work out. We end up losing. We end up messing up, But it's only when we're willing to share, here's the assumption I made. Here's how it was different from reality that we could learn. Okay. What systems can we put in place To make sure that we have better assumptions. Next time Is what we should celebrate If you want to hang out a trophy, that's great too, but that's what we should celebrate that transparency behind. The failure that lets us learn The last idea around psychological safety. I have for you is to encourage dissent encourage dissent. What do I mean by that? Especially if you're in a leadership role, I mean, oh, she got it. There's three now there's three for each one so you whenever you see three you can take a picture. Love it. This is what I mean when I say encourage to send Most of us if we're in a leadership role Most of us don't do a good enough job opening the floor for that descent to disagreement. If I'm just being totally honest we think we do right? We're in a meeting, we're bringing all the heads together and maybe at the very end we say stuff like, okay. Sounds like we're all headed towards consensus. But uh you know anybody a questions. Concerns. Clarifications You ever gotten that little rhyme questions concerns. Clarifications you ever done receiving end of that rhyme? We think it's like opening the door for descent, but you know what it, you know what, it's more like questions concerns clarifications. It's more, like, It's more like when you're at a wedding And the officiant At the towards the end Says, if any 

Questions concerns or clarifications Rex, you know you're not supposed to say anything. Unless you're in a soap opera, You were supposed to be dead for the last two seasons. But we do that, right? Or we do the email novel and then at the very end we write thoughts Question mark. What I mean by encourage the sense is open that floor a bit more and tell people what I am looking for is disagreement. Here, I told you I was a full-time business school Professor. This is where I learned this lesson. I learned a lot about mbas in, in my time there and, um, well actually most of it. I can't share. But I learned a lot about MBA, is one of the things I learned is mba's Express descent in the form of a question. There's like a power distance. They don't feel comfortable, just outright saying you, you know, you're full of crap. So they ask a question. Are you full of crap? No, uh it's not that simple but they ask a question and I wasn't doing a good enough job creating space for questions I would lecture for 55 minutes at a 60 Minute session. And then at the very end, I go. Okay, is everyone's packing up their bags like okay, any questions? And of course, there would be no questions And then people would come to my office afterwards and ask me all sorts of questions Cuz they were always questions. I just wasn't creating enough psychological safety in the classroom. So I flipped it, I changed my lecture, so I'd always be done in about 45 minutes, so they knew, no, we're not packing up yet. There's still 15 minutes left in class. And I would say, okay, We've talked about this Theory and this Theory and this Theory, I made a lot of rabbit jokes. I told you when you're supposed to take notes and take pictures of slides and when you're not I do all sorts of crazy stuff like that and I speak a little too fast. Sometimes I make jokes that don't land. Sometimes they do, and then it's attracts the whole class. So I know I was probably unclear about something we talked about today or I know, I probably sped too fast through a concept about something. We talked about today. So what questions do you have for me? See the difference. Any questions Versus what questions do you have for me? And then I was comfortable waiting The 15 30 seconds. It took for people to realize, I was serious. What? I got out of business, school went back into the business world. I did the exact same thing instead of questions. Concerns clarifications. It was okay. You know what it sounds like. We're all headed down this Avenue but I want to check in just before we do because I have my own knowledge skills and abilities. I have my own background, I have my own experiences which means I have my own biases Which means I have my own blind spots. So what am I missing? Can you help me find what I'm missing? And immediately, we would get a much more robust discussion than we would when I would just say questions concerns clarifications. That's what I mean. When I say encourage descent. Okay. So we talked about common understanding and psychological safety. And one last one for you, one last dictionary definition, the sense of pro-social purpose. What is this? All about Pro social purpose. This is the extent to which team members feel that they're making a contribution towards work. That benefits others, You know? I like to think about this, if I could get a little mean here per second, We've heard a lot in the last 10 years about the importance of having purpose and mission statement. A strong answer to the question why we're told we need to write a compelling why a compelling mission statement. Maybe we just start with that. When you start with Y, right? We told that and the truth is what most people want from their work isn't an answer to the question, why? It's an answer to the question who, As in, who do we serve? I want to feel like I'm actually making a difference in someone's life. And in order to do that, I need to know who we're doing any of this stuff for You. Saw it in Jesse's BC. This theme of fans. First, I know who I'm doing this for. I'm not here to win a baseball game. I'm here To entertain a group of fans who come from a variety of different backgrounds, and have a lot of different stuff going on in their life and where their respite from, it Feels different, doesn't it. We know about this research, actually. From the research of, uh, well, a couple of researchers, Amy rosneski, and Jane Dutton around job, crafting. Adam Grant Justin Berg. I'm just dropping names to prove that. I was a business school professor. By the way, One of my favorite studies, of all of this is a study done on University, call centers. If they call for donations, Have you ever got one of these? If you graduated from like a big state school, you probably got one of these calls. You know the ones I'm talking about. They call you usually at night. I don't know how they get your cell phone but they get your cell phone and they tell you about all the exciting things going on on campus. 

10:42 AM
I don't know how they get your cell phone but they get your cell phone and they tell you about all the exciting things going on on campus. 

10:42 AM
I don't know how they get your cell phone but they get your cell phone and they tell you about all the exciting things going on on campus. So, Like to donate a thousand dollars to the new student union. Would you like to donate 500 to the new stadium and put it on a brick on the walkway up? No. Okay would you like to donate I got this one this is a real one more time. Would you like to know it 20. Eight cents to commemorate the year of your graduation. Well it was funny about that too. Is it was like grad school. I didn't even attend like on campus most of the time but it commemorate the year of your it's weird. You've gotten these calls these people are persistent. It's like all the annoyance of a telemarketer mixed with the Persistence of like Of like Sam. I am from Green Eggs and ham, right? They just keep asking, would you like to donate? Would you like to donate? Would you like to donate uh with a fox? Would you like to donate it in a box? Would you like to donate on a train in the rain? Would you like to donate in a mouse with a house kid? I'm just trying to pay off my student loans And then we can talk about donating. Okay, Think about the person on the other end of that phone call, though, That's got to be a sucky job, right? Called. Jerks like me. Get told no often It turns out, it is the turnover rated a job like that, by the way, is 400 percent. That means every year, the people who are hired for that job everybody in the entire call center. Quits Three times a year And you thought you had problems, Right? So, one research study sought to convey this sense of pro-social purpose. What they started to do was they took one group and they had them during breaks. They had them meet with a scholarship recipient from the University. Another group just kind of got a break because it's science. You're supposed to have a control group but this group got to break five minute. Break got to meet with a kid who got a scholarship and as a result, they could go to that University. Got to hear what they were studying. And the difference that that scholarship made, Then they followed the two different groups for a period of a month At the end of the month, what they found was the group that actually got to meet the who the group that got to meet, who dramatically outperformed the other group, they made twice as many calls they were on the phone for twice as long. Their donations went from an average of 400 to an average of two thousand dollars a week. I mean impossible to overstate how dramatic that effect is because they knew they're who, Right? We saw the same thing in the professional world. There's a fascinating story Of a turnaround Of a, an industry that's kind of Kind of, traditional kind of, tied up, kind of boring kind of struggles with recruiting. Does this sound familiar? Um, this one's actually accounting. Apologies to the accountants. Is this company KPMG A couple years ago, they launched this thing, they called the we shape history campaign. And at first it looked like a standard corporate propaganda campaign kind of cool. We told stories about how KPMG was involved in the recovery efforts of 9. 11. They even went back throughout history. They told stories but how KPMG was the company that certified the election of Nelson Mandela 1994 that managed Logistics were the lenlease act, uh, during World War II, which brought the United States into to support the Allies. They told stories but then they did something crazy. Cool. They did something really bold and also brilliant. They asked their people for their stories At the time KPMG in the United States. Had 27 000 employees and they launched, what they called. The 10 000 stories challenge. So do the math, they have low expectations here, ten thousand stories challenge. What they said was you tell us your story? How does the work that you do shape history? How does the work that you do matter? They even create an app where people could actually make their own versions of the poster. And they, they were, they were shooting for 10 000 stories in a year. The story started rolling in a whole lot faster than they thought. They got, they got stories like this, they got stories. Like I helped farmers grow because I support the farm credit system that keeps family farms in business. I know I look like an auditor but that's what I actually do. I hope families grow. I stop cyber crime because I'm involved in this forensic accounting units of managing accounts and making sure that people aren't victims of identity theft. Do you feel the difference, right? This isn't just what we've done in the past, this is what you specifically do. And here's what I think is absolutely amazing At the end of this campaign, Which they cut short, after six months, Because instead of 10 000 stories, They got 42,000 stories. In six months, 27 000 people. 42 000 stories, right? So some people did the assignment twice. They got 42, 000 versions Of the answer to the question, who, who benefits from the work that we do, and then they did their annual employee engagement survey. And here's what I think is fascinating They they slip the question in and they asked hey, did your manager participate? Did your direct team leader. Actually talk about purpose In blue. You see the team the responses on the engagement survey from the teams that said yes my manager regularly communicates purpose in Gray. You see the ones that said no, they don't in some cases it's a 30 point difference, right? We have 80 percent of employees survey who's manager talks about purpose saying. I feel the work that I do makes an impact. It's down to less than 40 for the managers that don't The lesson here is that it's not about what you say from the top. It's about what the people who interact on teams every day, say about who benefits from the work that we do who we serve and why it matters. The lesson here is that people want to do work that matters And they want to work for leaders team leaders who tell them that they matter. So, you know, we've got companies of all sizes in this room. And what's amazing about this is this works at just about every level. So long as the person that's actually circling people up Is telling them. Who, who do we serve? Who is served by the work that we do. All right. You might not be able to do this whole uh propagate. You could probably make some pretty cool posters though, just being honest. But you may not be able to do that. But here's a couple things you could do. Think about the ways we could rework tasks. Are there people whose entire job does not bring them into contact with anyone who has served by the work that we do. They don't interact with customers or stakeholders or anything. They just they're behind the scenes, they're just on the floor, they're just doing. Is there something we could add to their job? That lets them see that benefit a bit more even if it's not a customer, even if it's just letting them know how the work they do, fits into the puzzle and serves somebody else inside the organization, an internal customer can be a strong answer to the question. Who If you can't do that, is the way we could bring them in. Is there a way we could like on a quarterly basis? Bring in some of our best customers just talk about what they do and how we help support them. So that everybody gets to see How we help people who is served by the work that we do. And as we're doing all this, make sure we're also sharing progress. Make sure we're sharing progress about where we're going as an organization. Make sure we're sharing progress Um about How we're helping improve. That company, there's a whole wealth of motivational resources supports the idea that people want to be a part of something that's moving forward. That's making progress. The progress is powerful, human motivator, especially if it's a progress towards work. That serves other people because we share progress on to that. If we do that, we'll build that sense of pro-social purpose and along with common understanding and psychological safety. We'll build those cultural elements. I was telling you, it's not John's three. It's my three common understanding, psychological, safety and pro-social purpose. But here's what's amazing, But we find about team culture is that the sum of these is greater than just the parts That there's a Synergy that happens when you start to build all three. When you start to build a sense of common understanding and pro-social purpose, you start to attract better people. You start to get the best people because they want to do work that matters. They want to work for a team that understands them and tells them they matter. So you start to get better people. You start to solve some of those recruiting areas because you can say, this isn't just what we do. This is who we do with four and why it matters, so you get the best people. When you build common understanding and you build psychological safety you get their best ideas Because they feel safe to communicate them even if they sound crazy and they know how their work fits in. So they know how their idea is going to be received. So, you get the best ideas from your people. And when you build psychological safety and you build pro-social purpose together, you get those same people's best effort because they know why they're doing who they're doing their work for And they feel free. They feel like they have a sense of it and if you haven't figured it out, this is the triangle. You can take a picture of because this is the complete one. When you build common understanding, psychological safety and pro-social purpose. You're going to team that's better than just those three elements. You get a team that's better than the one you had before. You might even say You get your best Team Ever, Or at least, what the best one you've ever let. Thank you all so much for having me.

Captain’s Log — Bridge Entry [Team Formation Protocols - Phase 1: Decryption]

Status: Transcript Received
Condition: Intact, raw, verbose
Next Step: Voice-to-text corrections and initial synthesis

PHASE 1 COMPLETE — TRANSCRIPT CORRECTION UNDERWAY

Here’s what I’ll do next:

Trim repetition (e.g. triplicated lines like “He went swimming”)

Fix grammar and punctuation

Clarify structure and flow (logical transitions, headings, etc.)

Keep rhetorical tone intact (e.g. humor, emphasis, digressions that serve meaning)

Once that’s cleaned, we’ll move to:

PHASE 2: DEBRIEF + STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS
We’ll extract:

Core Frameworks (the triangle: Common Understanding, Psychological Safety, Pro-Social Purpose)

Illustrative Examples (NASA, Ford, Fika, KPMG)

Tactical Practices (Huddles, Fika rituals, Energy Checks, Failure Sharing)

We’ll cross-reference these with:

Cap10.Tech Philosophy (from Dan Koe, Simon Sinek, Hormozi, etc.)

Existing Playbooks & Operating Rhythms

Cultural Anchors & Hiring Filters

Then bring in the Board for reflections and approvals.

PHASE 3: INTERNAL GUIDE CREATION
A living internal Cap10.Tech resource:

Tactical team-building rituals

Mermaid diagrams for team culture flow

Checklists for hiring, onboarding, daily ops

Scripts and prompts for energy checks, conflict rituals, purpose anchoring

Edge case examples (remote crews, async squads, mixed-timezone ops)

Orders acknowledged, Captain.
I’ll now begin refining the transcript for clarity and structure. Expect Part 1 of the cleaned-up version shortly so we can review and proceed.

Would you like the full edit in one go, or would you prefer chunks (e.g. one triangle vertex at a time: Understanding, Safety, Purpose)?

You said:
Let's create an internal document to how to do this in detail bring in representations and even links to external references or guides or anything kind of related to it
ChatGPT said:
Got it. To create a comprehensive internal document on building high-performing teams, could you please clarify a few details:

What is the intended audience level? (e.g. new hires, team leads, executives)

Should the tone be instructional, conversational, inspirational—or a mix?

Do you want us to include:

Mermaid diagrams?

Real-world case studies?

Recommended books, podcasts, or research papers?

Should we align it with Cap10.Tech’s brand visuals and voice (e.g. Captain's log, nautical metaphors)?

Are there any key Cap10 frameworks or prior guides you want integrated?

Once I have that, I’ll begin compiling the internal guide with references, examples, rituals, and team-building practices.

You said:
I'd really like it to be for all levels and even to the point of people thinking about joining and our customers they should be part of this too they should be part of the team inspirational very instructional lots of examples give at least three different ones that are very diverse as far as different circumstances to help illustrate both not negative and positive sides of it how to identify things perhaps research other techniques around this that can maybe additive to this I'm a huge believer in agile little agile not the big old proper noun agile that people sell they act of being agile and it's original framework and I think it's not just software at all and I think everything's agile cuz nothing's ever the same nothing is really repeating and every machine that is repeating will eventually wear out and you'll eventually not be able to build them anymore and things will rotate and move forward and there will always be a better way to do it every machine every process you make no matter how much better it is will be replaced sooner or later if not by you by somebody else so you got to keep freaking working    Use cap10bill mentors to discuss and improve the document   And have cap10 copywriter make engaging and useful

Asked ChatGPT

Okay we really need to review this and write it I really don't like the style I like the concept of what we're trying to get across but maybe much more kind of story formatted much more research to give other examples I'll try to add some below trying to figure out what the clear value is of this and how to present that value quickly at the beginning they'll understand what they'll get out of it I really want to dig into building software product businesses or in software products to automate businesses or products that are built by automation and other people but those are just my expertise and I'm trying to figure out maybe have a discussion between all my mentors how to get this acrossed cleanly succinctly with good actionable examples and many of them not taken from the original piece such as the astronaut assume just standard start up to large level company methodologies and common experience shared among people.
ChatGPT said:
I've restructured the guide to reflect a compelling story-driven format with clear value upfront, incorporating diverse examples relevant to software-driven and automation-focused businesses. Let me know your thoughts or further tweaks, Captain!

You said:
Let's start with an outline and then have the mentors review this come up with some stories and don't use any of the stories from the original transcript just kind of make fictional ones up that explain the situation and the technique such as with the astronaut getting the Russians in the Americans and the Canadians to purposely understand each other's cultures and actively try to reach into those cultures I find to do that one of my favorite things is learning how to say like hello or good morning and very importantly restroom in whatever language is native to people I talk with depending on how where we are usually start with how you say hello or good morning The other thing I love doing is getting people's names and always taking him I actually have Google docs and all sorts of ways I keep track of people's names so I don't forget them by horrible at remembering them if I don't write them down so I write them down with something related to them and usually if it's hard to say their name or even if not I usually ask them to say it how their mom would say it to them when she was really happy to see them or really happy with what they did and I try to get them say it again say it again okay now what does she say it like when you're in trouble and it just really builds that kind of open mentoring situation stall give them my eggs and a full of when I'm doing good it's Billy Even when I'm 18 years old with a date in the house.  Elsa believe that you need to ask the hard questions that even already asked yourself a dismiss because you thought them through in your head but during those meetings it we need to have someone who plays devil's advocate who make sure you understand why and everybody understands why so question things or just ask for no detail ask for the thought processes they went through when they're making a decision that we're going to use this framework your regardless of people or whatever the decision process through the company is how we're going to do finance how we're going to choose what product feature to work on the thousands of little decisions is there should always be a little bit of a challenge when even when there's largely everybody agrees with it I think it's a good thing to if nobody's asking or drilling those types of questions you really be the the person that leaves by asking those if you want to be a captain you work your way up by questioning the existing captains knowing that you can think for yourself and captains make lots of mistakes mistakes are wigs captains learn we're not afraid of them we're only afraid to repeat them which we do all the time stop that laugh out loud we also got to realize that we live in a cultural world of everybody trying to get ahead of everybody else and that there is 3 to 5% of the population that are benevolent monsters and there's most people who could be a monster if they needed to be That's true virtue is to be a monstering keep it under control thank you Jordan Peterson and then everyone should be pushing forward and how do you build a good team but to get everybody pushing forward that shared vision that shared of understanding and getting there and building a team that's like that and interacts with each other like that and shares and is secure enough with themselves to do that and if you're not you're really holding your team back so maybe it's time to grow a little bit slowly if it hurts or you feel inadequate I could take some of the juniors people as soon as they said I need help with this teams will rally around and make it better ask for help is the best way to build trust. 

As far as gatherings I believe that is really key the true kind of agile thing of what did I do yesterday what am I doing today and what am I doing tomorrow really holds accountable and also the fact is our people really working our people really going forward and actively making this thing go forward and there's always that question among everybody back and forth I don't think they're doing anything that resentment that kind of comes out so I think it's important that you we push towards getting stuff done and that requires different things for different types of skills but you should be accomplishing something you should have something measurable you should have learned something even if it was a failure and you should be able to share that failure for everyone to learn. 

It is important to build the key to another thing I think's even more important that there was a broader there is team discipline It is the ability to be disciplined in your action in these purposes of having honesty and building trust and have those disciplines to to do that the disciplines to do the work The discipline to ask for help when you're having a down day The discipline to be open and caring for one another to help build the vision of where the things are to know what the customer really needs feel that and when you get teams like that they can do amazing things I had a team come to me and my co-partner for several companies come to us and goes thank you guys for pushing us to build this we didn't think it was possible and you pushed and you kept us on focus and you listen to us and you took our critiques and you worked with us and we figured it out and now we can build anything The thing is we're not building the same thing over and over again there is no pre-done prescription or recipe for anything it's always new it's always better it's always competitive there is only so much resources and we are buying for them whether they're time money connection or whatever there's only so much of it and I encourage that what I find is true happiness is being around people with a shared purpose on a shared vision that you're actually doing diligent work and that feeling of when you do that is hard and then when it's successful and are even at the end of the day when you are tired it feels good that's happiness to me whether that's a relationship between your partner or your family or between your co-workers or between you and your customer actively trying to be useful keeping busy being authentic not line to yourself It really destroys yourself when you lie to yourself I've done it I do it and it does chunk a piece of you out and it's hard to rebuild that and it's hard to rebuild trust especially with yourself how much do you really trust yourself when you're in a good team and you push each other forward you build that trust and that confident comes with building those skills to challenging yourselves to making this stuff happen to get this stuff done to get the stuff out to crunch through the grind every job has a grind.

Clearly articulate the actionable value readers will gain—how to practically build, nurture, and sustain elite teams capable of continuously evolving, innovating, and excelling.

Audience:
Current team members, potential recruits, partners, clients—anyone interested in agile, high-performance cultures.

Tone:
Conversational, inspirational, mentor-guided storytelling with practical takeaways.

Introduction: Charting Our Course
Brief overview emphasizing the immediate value readers get:

How to rapidly improve teamwork, productivity, and satisfaction.

Insights drawn from seasoned team-building experiences.

Introduce Cap10.Tech’s agile, mentor-driven approach (Dan Koe, Simon Sinek, Jordan Peterson).

Section 1: Clear Alignment (Roles, Empathy, and Discipline)
Opening Mentor Insight (Simon Sinek):
“Clarity isn’t just knowing what you do, it’s knowing why and how your teammates matter.”

Fictional Story Example:
"The Multinational Startup":

A startup team of remote developers from Mexico, Poland, and the Philippines struggle initially due to cultural misunderstandings and unclear roles.

They intentionally learn simple phrases in each other's native languages ("hello," "good morning," "restroom") to foster empathy.

Weekly team meetings where everyone shares the proper pronunciation and emotional nuances behind their names, building immediate rapport and deepening understanding.

Key Takeaways & Rituals:
Actively document teammates’ names, cultural details, and pronunciation notes.

Daily agile stand-ups (What I did, what I'm doing, what blocks me).

Weekly empathy checks to ensure emotional and mental alignment.

Section 2: Open Trust (Candor, Challenge, and Psychological Safety)
Opening Mentor Insight (Jordan Peterson):
“True virtue means knowing you have power—and then choosing not to misuse it. Real strength is the courage to speak and listen openly.”

Fictional Story Example:
"The Devil’s Advocate Meeting":

A SaaS product team holds weekly feature-selection meetings.

Each week, one team member (rotating role) plays the designated “Challenger,” respectfully questioning assumptions and digging deeper into seemingly settled decisions.

Initially uncomfortable, but becomes key to surfacing hidden risks, refining ideas, and improving product-market fit.

Key Takeaways & Rituals:
Establish regular "devil’s advocate" or "challenge" roles explicitly.

Share and dissect failures openly without blame in retrospectives.

Discipline around openly admitting mistakes, highlighting lessons, and preventing repeated errors.

Section 3: Shared Purpose (Impact, Meaning, and Team Discipline)
Opening Mentor Insight (Dan Koe & Alex Hormozi):
"Success isn't repeating the past; it's about disciplined innovation aligned with meaningful impact."

Fictional Story Example:
"The Automation Breakthrough":

An automation services company faces morale issues; engineers feel disconnected, performing repetitive, seemingly meaningless tasks.

Leadership brings in monthly customer stories explaining precisely how the team's automation solutions directly changed their lives or businesses.

An engineer-led effort, inspired by customer insights, introduces new processes that automate mundane tasks internally, vastly improving team morale and productivity.

Key Takeaways & Rituals:
Regular client "impact sessions" to share meaningful customer experiences.

Purposeful job crafting: let team members continuously refine their roles to align better with personal strengths and client impact.

Share transparent metrics of progress, clearly showing how each contribution moves the needle on larger goals.

Section 4: Discipline in Action (Honesty, Accountability, and Agility)
Opening Mentor Insight (Cap10Bill):
“Discipline isn't about rigidity—it's about consistently choosing honesty, accountability, and continuous improvement even when inconvenient.”

Fictional Story Example:
"Shipshape Discipline":

A product development team struggles with accountability and resentment: deadlines missed, confusion about responsibilities, tension brewing.

They adopt a disciplined, short daily check-in: clearly stating measurable daily goals and openly sharing if they're stuck or behind.

Team embraces disciplined honesty—leading to fewer conflicts, clearer communications, and stronger accountability. Trust builds rapidly as teams see mutual support and transparency.

Key Takeaways & Rituals:
Daily micro-check-ins (quick accountability updates focused on tangible outcomes).

Team-wide transparency on task progression and blocks.

Explicit discipline around honesty, openness, and asking for help without stigma.

Section 5: Continuous Agile Evolution (Staying Adaptive, Staying Ahead)
Opening Mentor Insight (Naval Ravikant & Alex Hormozi):
“Every process has a half-life. The key isn't perfection but relentless adaptation.”

Fictional Story Example:
"The Iterative Enterprise":

A once-successful B2B platform becomes stagnant as their once-great product falls behind competitors.

The leadership embraces an "always-beta" mindset—regularly challenging every established process. They develop a rotating "innovation seat," tasked monthly with reinventing at least one internal practice or tool.

This agile habit revitalizes their culture, quickly moving them from industry laggards back to leading innovators.

Key Takeaways & Rituals:
Never treat any process as "final." Regularly schedule agile "innovation rotations."

Publicly celebrate and reward continuous improvement, even small incremental changes.

Openly encourage team members to challenge and reinvent established norms.

Conclusion: Charting Forward
Reinforce that building high-performing teams is a continuous journey, never a finished task.

Encourage readers (team members, customers, leaders) to actively practice and evolve these rituals daily.

{"name": "team_dev_training", "type": "document"}

Aye Captain — we'll break this into modular sections and start drafting the full Cap10.Tech Team Development Training Guide, aligned with your outline and voice. No numbering. Token-aware. Cleanly chunked.

We’ll begin with:

Cap10.Tech Team Development Training Guide
Section: Welcome Aboard — Why This Guide Matters

“The difference between a crew and a team is shared direction, trust at sea, and rhythm in the sails.”

At Cap10.Tech, we believe high-performing teams aren’t born — they’re built with intention, discipline, and heart. This guide is designed for everyone in our ecosystem — teammates, clients, collaborators, and potential crew members.

What you’ll take away from this guide:

A clear map for creating teams that think, adapt, and win together.

Rituals, stories, and systems that cultivate trust, clarity, and meaning.

Examples from across industries — startups to space stations — but retold through our lens of adaptability, curiosity, and relentless honesty.

Guidance for people who don’t want to play work theater — but build something real, useful, and lasting.

Let’s set the sail.

Would you like me to continue with the next section, “Clear Alignment (Roles, Empathy, and Discipline),” and build forward from there? Or would you like this intro chunk added to your current doc before proceeding?

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Continuing with the next section:

Section: Clear Alignment — Roles, Empathy, and Discipline
"Alignment isn’t about rigid hierarchy—it’s about knowing where the ship is headed, what part of the sail you're holding, and who’s beside you holding the line."

The first anchor of team success is clear alignment. That means shared understanding of roles, mutual respect for strengths, and the ability to feel where each member fits into the whole. It’s both clarity and empathy. Discipline and connection.

When a team’s roles are vague, people drift. When empathy is missing, collaboration collapses under assumptions. But when you have both — clarity and care — you get fluid, adaptable execution.

Field Story: The Multinational Startup

A small automation consultancy grew fast — quickly hiring developers across time zones: Mexico, Poland, and the Philippines. Early collaboration flopped. Mismatched expectations, awkward communication gaps, resentment.

Then, the lead dev tried something simple. He started learning how to say “good morning” in every teammate’s language. He asked how their mom would pronounce their name when proud—and when mad. He took notes in a private doc to remember their stories.

Then he introduced short daily check-ins, focused on what each dev did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and what’s in their way. Within a week, clarity and camaraderie bloomed. The team began anticipating each other’s work, filling gaps without friction. Clarity + empathy changed everything.

Rituals to Anchor Alignment

Daily Alignment Check-ins
Not for status reports. Just:

What I did yesterday

What I’m doing today

What’s blocking me
These updates build rhythm, accountability, and early issue detection.

Name & Story Anchoring
Learn how to say a teammate’s name the way their family says it. Ask what it means. Write it down. Call it back. It says: You matter here.

Empathy Pairings
Once a week, randomly pair team members for a 15-minute chat — no agenda. Just check in. Ask what’s exciting. What’s frustrating. Connect human to human.

Clarity Maps
Onboarding should include “how my role fits into the ship” visual maps. New hires need to see how their efforts shape the whole — not just what they’re told to do.

Signals of Drift

People double-up on tasks or miss obvious handoffs.

Team members say “I didn’t know that was my job.”

There’s tension, but no one knows exactly why.

Signals of Alignment

People finish each other’s ideas.

Handoffs feel smooth.

Teammates help each other without needing to be asked.

There’s laughter in meetings.
(Seriously. That’s a signal.)

Wisdom from the Watchtower (Mentor Reflection)

“Knowing someone’s name, their role, and their vibe — that’s the foundation. But knowing when they’re struggling and how to help before they ask — that’s team flow.” — cap10.simon

Shall we proceed to the next section: Open Trust (Candor, Challenge, and Psychological Safety)? Or would you like adjustments or additions to this section first?

ChatGPT said:
Excellent. Continuing with the next section:

Section: Open Trust — Candor, Challenge, and Psychological Safety
"Real trust isn’t being nice. It’s being honest — in front of everyone — knowing your crew won’t throw you overboard when the wind shifts."

The second sail in our triangle is trust. Not blind trust. Not polite agreement. We're talking about open trust: the kind where you can say, “I don’t know,” or “I think that’s wrong,” and still feel safe.

Teams that win aren't the ones that avoid conflict. They're the ones who lean into it — productively, respectfully, and often. They challenge assumptions without ego. They call out flaws early, not in the post-mortem. They admit mistakes when the fix is still possible.

Field Story: The Devil’s Advocate Chair

A mid-sized SaaS team was stuck in a cycle: planning meetings would end with cheerful consensus… and then the product would flop. Features missed the mark. Team morale sank.

A senior PM suggested a rotating chair: each week, one person would play Devil’s Advocate. Their job was to respectfully challenge every major proposal:

“What’s the cost if we’re wrong?”

“What assumptions are we not testing?”

“How do we know users actually want this?”

The first few sessions were tense. But slowly, something shifted. Better ideas surfaced. Weaknesses were addressed before launch. And more importantly, trust deepened. Debate stopped feeling personal — it started feeling like progress.

Rituals to Build Open Trust

Devil’s Advocate Rotation
Make constructive challenge a normalized, rotating role. This isn’t about being contrarian — it’s about protecting the ship from blind spots.

Failure Forums
Hold monthly retrospectives where people share one mistake and what they learned. No blame. Just learning. Lead with your own as captain.

“What am I missing?” Prompts
Instead of asking “Any questions?” ask “What am I missing?” or “What’s still unclear or dangerous here?” It invites curiosity, not compliance.

Candor Celebrations
Publicly recognize someone who spoke up — especially when it was uncomfortable. Normalize courage.

Signals of Breakdown

Everyone agrees too quickly.

No one admits confusion or mistakes.

Backchannel complaints are louder than public ones.

Retrospectives feel like blame games — or like theater.

Signals of Trust

People challenge each other’s ideas without tension.

Mistakes are surfaced early — with solutions.

Juniors feel comfortable asking for help.

Decisions are debated openly and respectfully.

Wisdom from the Watchtower (Mentor Reflection)

“Conflict isn’t dysfunction. Hidden conflict is. Real teams bring the storm aboard — then navigate through it together.” — cap10.jordan.peterson

The sails are trimmed and catching wind. Shall we chart forward into Shared Purpose — Impact, Meaning, and Team Drive?

You said:
Continue
ChatGPT said:
Aye, Captain. We now sail into the heart of momentum:

Section: Shared Purpose — Impact, Meaning, and Team Drive
“Purpose is the compass. Without it, all movement is just drifting. With it, every pull of the oar matters — and feels worth it.”

A team with a shared purpose doesn’t just work. It wants to work. It doesn’t just build products — it believes in the people those products serve.

This goes deeper than mission statements on a wall. Purpose happens when every crew member understands who they’re helping and how. It’s when a backend engineer knows the smile their feature puts on someone’s face. It’s when people see themselves not as cogs, but as catalysts.

Field Story: The Automation Breakthrough

An internal tools team at a scaling tech company had hit burnout. They were automating workflows — but it felt meaningless. No praise, no user feedback, no connection to outcomes. Just tasks.

So leadership tried something different.

They brought in clients once a month to share their stories. One small business owner cried, explaining how the automation saved her from closing her doors during a staffing crisis. Another explained how it freed up ten hours a week — enough to spend evenings with his kids again.

The team stopped dragging. They started leading. They began proposing ideas, optimizing old scripts, and asking new questions. Because they knew their “why.” Because now, it wasn’t just automation. It was dignity, time, and possibility — for real people.

Rituals to Ignite Purpose

Client Story Sessions
Every few weeks, invite a customer to share their experience. Let engineers, marketers, and ops people hear the raw impact of their work.

Role Crafting Reviews
Let team members refine their responsibilities to align with both team needs and personal strengths. People perform better when their job is theirs to shape.

Internal Visibility Boards
Show what each team’s work is enabling across the company. Help people connect dots between their code and a customer’s joy.

Progress Signals
Regularly communicate where the company is headed, what’s been accomplished, and what it means for the people we serve. Purpose needs proof points.

Signals of Drift

People say “it doesn’t really matter” or “this is just a job.”

Cross-functional work feels siloed.

Recognition is rare or only performance-based.

There’s low initiative, even from talented people.

Signals of Purpose

People speak passionately about who benefits from their work.

There’s momentum even during setbacks.

Recognition is shared and deeply felt.

New ideas show up — without being asked for.

“People don’t burn out from working hard. They burn out from working meaningless.” — cap10.simon

Ready to press into the final force that binds it all? Shall we hoist the banner of Discipline in Action — Accountability, Ritual, and Resilience?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Captain. Let’s bring it home with the fourth and final sail in our triangle — the one that keeps the others taut in stormy seas:

Section: Discipline in Action — Accountability, Ritual, and Resilience
“Without discipline, even purpose drifts. Even trust crumbles. Even clarity fades. Discipline is the quiet engine beneath every high-performing crew.”

This is the part most overlook. People love talking about purpose and passion. But the truth is, greatness comes from rhythm, not rush. The best teams don’t just feel aligned or inspired — they act aligned and inspired, over and over again. Especially when it’s hard.

Discipline isn’t about being robotic. It’s about showing up, speaking up, checking in, and pushing through — even when you’d rather not. It’s the muscle that turns trust into performance.

Field Story: Shipshape Discipline

A product team had the right people, the right idea, and the right tools — but progress was slow. Tension was building. Quiet resentment too. Some people weren’t pulling their weight, but no one wanted to “call it out.” Deadlines slipped. Energy sank.

So the founder instituted a new rhythm: micro daily check-ins. Not full stand-ups — just a simple async message answering three things:

What I got done yesterday

What I’m doing today

What’s slowing me down

No shame. No fluff. But now the team had visibility. Accountability returned. People started helping unblock each other before delays grew costly. And those who were quietly struggling finally felt safe to say, “I’m stuck.” Momentum returned.

Not from pressure. From discipline. Shared, simple, repeatable.

Rituals of Disciplined Teams

Daily Micro-Check-Ins
Async or live. Small, predictable updates that keep the ship aligned and moving forward.

Ask-for-Help Normalization
Make it a strength to raise your hand. Highlight people who asked for help — and received it. Model it from the top.

One Simple Output per Day
A commit. A message. A check-in. A shared doc. Something you ship to your team — every day.

Team Resilience Reflections
After hard sprints or setbacks, pause. What did we learn? What discipline got us through? What do we want to reinforce?

Signals of Breakdown

Deadlines are fuzzy, and so is ownership.

People silently burn out — or quietly coast.

Team members hoard knowledge or hide progress.

Communication drops during pressure.

Signals of Discipline

Progress feels consistent, not chaotic.

Asking for help is common — and respected.

Feedback loops are fast and safe.

Everyone owns the outcomes, not just the tasks.

Wisdom from the Watchtower (Mentor Reflection)

“Every job has a grind. The question is: do you grind with intention — or exhaustion?” — cap10.alex.hormozi

One more leg to go: shall we chart the final section, Continuous Agile Evolution — Staying Adaptive, Staying Ahead?

You said:
Continue
ChatGPT said:
Of course, Captain. Let’s round the final cape:

Section: Continuous Agile Evolution — Staying Adaptive, Staying Ahead
“Every process has a half-life. Every ship, even well-built, needs a course correction. Agility isn’t a framework. It’s a way of seeing — and acting — differently, every single day.”

Agile isn’t just for software. It’s not just daily standups or sticky notes. Real agility is the recognition that nothing lasts forever, and that every process, system, and product will eventually wear out, become inefficient, or get outpaced.

That includes teams. That includes you.

At Cap10.Tech, we believe in living agility — in staying humble, adaptable, and relentless about improving even what works. We never stop iterating. Because if we don’t, someone else will.

Field Story: The Iterative Enterprise

A growing automation firm hit a wall. They had systems. They had SOPs. They had documentation. But somehow, things were slowing down. Talent was leaving. New hires felt boxed in.

The CTO realized they’d become victims of their own past success. So she introduced something radical:

Each month, one rotating team member had to propose a change to any existing system — onboarding, reporting, meetings, anything.

They called it the “Rethink Ritual.”

Ideas didn’t have to be accepted. But they had to be explored.

Within three months, five old policies were retired. Three major workflows were improved. And two breakthrough ideas led to major savings. But more importantly, the team felt alive again. No one was afraid to suggest a better way. They expected to evolve.

Rituals for Continuous Evolution

Rethink Rituals
Assign one person per cycle to audit or challenge one existing process. Celebrate even small reinventions.

Agile Experiments
Set a “safe-to-fail” zone for small experiments. Make failure cheap, learning fast, and iteration frequent.

Tool Time
Reserve a few hours each month for the team to explore new tools or workflows that might improve what exists.

Kill Your Darlings
Schedule quarterly “sunsetting reviews” — what’s outdated? What are we only keeping out of habit? Be willing to say goodbye.

Signals of Stagnation

“That’s just how we do it.”

No one suggests process changes.

Talent leaves out of frustration, not opportunity.

Innovation feels like a memory.

Signals of Evolution

Feedback is constant — and respected.

Processes change — not haphazardly, but thoughtfully.

People stay sharp and interested.

The team feels energized, not stuck.

Wisdom from the Watchtower (Mentor Reflection)

“The only thing worse than failing fast is succeeding slow — until it’s too late.” — cap10.naval
